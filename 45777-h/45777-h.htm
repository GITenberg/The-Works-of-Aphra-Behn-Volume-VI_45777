<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p><i>La M&ocirc;ntre: or, The Lover's Watch</i>, 'Licensed 2 Aug. 1686. R.L.S.' is
taken by Mrs. Behn from <i>La M&ocirc;ntre</i> of Balthazar de Bonnecorse. After
having received an excellent education at Marseilles, where he was born,
de Bonnecorse was appointed consul at Cairo, and later transferred to Sidon
in the Levant. Whilst at Cairo he composed <i>La M&ocirc;ntre</i>, a mixture of prose
and verse, which he sent to the great arbiter of Parisian taste, Georges de
Scud&eacute;ri, under whose care it was printed in 1666 at Paris. It was followed
in 1671 by the second part, <i>la Bo&euml;te et le Miroir</i>, dedicated to the Duke de
Vivonne. Upon his return to France, de Bonnecorse abridged <i>La M&ocirc;ntre</i>
and put it wholly into verse, in which form it appears in his collected (yet
incomplete) works, 'Chez Theodore Haak.' Leyden, 1720. Bonnecorse
died at Marseilles in 1706. He is always piquant and graceful in his madrigals
and songs, though both sentiment and verse have faded a little with the
passing of time. Boileau immortalized him in <i>Le Lutrin: la M&ocirc;ntre</i> is one
of the missiles the enraged canons hurl at each other's reverend pates:
'L'un prend <i>l'Edit d'amour</i>, l'autre en saisit <i>la M&ocirc;ntre</i>.' Bonnecorse's
attempted parody on <i>Le Lutrin, le Lutrigot</i> (Marseille, 1686), is of no value,
and brought a caustic epigram down on his head.</p>

<h3>
To Peter Weston, Esq.;<br />
Of The Honourable Society Of The Inner-Temple.
</h3>

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">Sir,</div>

<p>When I had ended this little unlaboured Piece, the <i>Watch</i>, I resolv'd to
dedicate it to some One, whom I cou'd fancy, the nearest approacht the
charming <i>Damon</i>. Many fine Gentlemen I had in view, of Wit and Beauty;
but still, through their Education, or a natural Propensity to Debauchery,
I found those Vertues wanting, that should compleat that delicate Character,
<i>Iris</i> gives her Lover; and which, at first Thought of You, I found center'd
there to Perfection.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, I found You had all the Youth of <i>Damon</i>; without the forward
noisy Confidence, which usually attends your Sex. You have all the attracting
Beauty of my young Hero; all that can charm the Fair; without the
Affectation of those, that set out for Conquests (though You make a
Thousand, without knowing it, or the Vanity of believing it.) You have
our <i>Damon's</i> Wit with all his agreeable Modesty: Two Vertues that rarely
shine together: And the last makes You conceal the noble Sallies of the first,
with that Industry and Care, You wou'd an Amour: And You wou'd no
more boast of either of these, than of your undoubted Bravery.</p>

<p>You are (like our Lover too) so discreet, that the bashful Maid may, without
Fear or Blushing, venture the soft Confession of the Soul with You;
reposing the dear Secret in Yours, with more Safety than with her own
Thoughts. You have all the Sweetness of Youth, with the Sobriety and
Prudence of Age. You have all the Power of the gay Vices of Man; but the
Angel in your Mind, has subdu'd you to the Vertues of a God! And all
the vicious and industrious Examples of the roving Wits of the mad Town,
have only served to give You the greater Abhorrence to Lewdness. And
You look down with Contempt and Pity on that wretched unthinking
Number, who pride themselves in their mean Victories over little Hearts;
and boast their common Prizes with that Vanity, that declares 'em capable
of no higher Joy, than that of the Ruin of some credulous Unfortunate: And
no Glory like that, of the Discovery of the brave Achievement, over the next
Bottle, to the Fool that shall applaud 'em.</p>

<p>How does the Generosity, and Sweetness of your Disposition despise these
false Entertainments, that turns the noble Passion of Love into Ridicule, and
Man into Brute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Methinks I cou'd form another <i>Watch</i> (that should remain a Pattern to
succeeding Ages) how divinely you pass your more sacred Hours, how nobly
and usefully You divide your Time: in which, no precious minute is lost,
not one glides idly by; but all turns to wondrous Account. And all Your
Life is one continu'd Course of Vertue and Honour. Happy the Parents
that have the Glory to own You! Happy the Man, that has the Honour
of your Friendship! But, oh! How much more happy the fair She, for
whom you shall sigh! Which surely, can never be in vain.</p>

<p>There will be such a Purity in Your Flame: All You ask will be so chaste
and noble, and utter'd with a Voice so modest, and a Look so charming, as
must, by a gentle Force, compel that Heart to yield, that knows the true
Value of Wit, Beauty, and Vertue.</p>

<p>Since then, in all the Excellencies of Mind and Body (where no one
Grace is wanting) you so resemble the All-perfect <i>Damon</i>, suffer me to
dedicate this <i>Watch</i> to You. It brings You nothing but Rules for Love;
delicate as Your Thoughts, and innocent as Your Conversation. And possibly,
'tis the only Vertue of the Mind, You are not perfectly Master of; the
only noble Mystery of the Soul, You have not yet studied. And though
they are Rules for every Hour, You will find, they will neither rob Heaven,
nor Your Friends of ther Due; those so valuable Devoirs of Your Life;
They will teach You Love; but Love, so pure, and so devout, that You
may mix it, even with Your Religion; and I know, Your fine Mind can
admit of no other. When ever the God enters there (fond and wanton as he
is, full of Arts and Guiles) he will be reduc'd to that Native Innocency,
that made him so ador'd, before inconstant Man corrupted his Divinity, and
made him wild and wandring. How happy will <i>Iris's</i> Watch be, to inspire
such a Heart! How honour'd under the Patronage of so excellent a Man!
Whose Wit will credit, whose Goodness will defend it; and whose noble
and vertuous Qualities so justly merit the Character <i>Iris</i> has given <i>Damon</i>:
And which is believed so very much your Due, by</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">Sir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19.5em;">Your most Obliged, and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">Most Humble Servant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 31.5em;">A. Behn.</span><br />

<h3>La Monstre.<br />

The <span class="smcap">Lover's</span> WATCH:
or, the ART of making LOVE.</h3>


<h4>The ARGUMENT.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>'Tis in the most happy and august Court of the best and greatest Monarch of
the World, that <i>Damon</i>, a young Nobleman, whom we will render under that
Name, languishes for a Maid of Quality, who will give us leave to call her <i>Iris</i>.</p>

<p>Their Births are equally illustrious; they are both rich, and both
young; their Beauty such as I dare not too nicely particularize, lest I should
discover (which I am not permitted to do) who these charming Lovers are.
Let it suffice, that <i>Iris</i> is the most fair and accomplisht Person that ever
adorn'd a Court; and that <i>Damon</i> is only worthy of the Glory of her Favour;
for he has all that can render him lovely in the fair Eyes of the amiable <i>Iris</i>.
Nor is he Master of those superficial Beauties alone, that please at first
sight; he can charm the Soul with a thousand Arts of Wit and Gallantry.
And, in a word, I may say, without flattering either, that there is no one
Beauty, no one Grace, no Perfection of Mind and Body, that wants to compleat
a Victory on both sides.</p>

<p>The agreement of Age, Fortunes, Quality and Humours in the two
fair Lovers, made the impatient <i>Damon</i> hope, that no thing would oppose
his Passion; and if he saw himself every hour languishing for the adorable
Maid, he did not however despair: And if <i>Iris</i> sigh'd, it was not for fear of
being one day more happy.</p>

<p>In the midst of the Tranquillity of these two Lovers, <i>Iris</i> was obliged
to go into the Country for some Months, whither 'twas impossible for
<i>Damon</i> to wait on her, he being oblig'd to attend the King his Master; and
being the most amorous of his Sex, suffer'd with extreme Impatience the
Absence of his Mistress. Nevertheless, he fail'd not to send to her every
day, and gave up all his melancholy Hours to Thinking, Sighing, and Writing
to her the softest Letters that Love could inspire. So that <i>Iris</i> even
blessed that Absence that gave her so tender and convincing Proofs of his
Passion; and found this dear way of Conversing, even recompensed all her
Sighs for his Absence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>After a little Intercourse of this kind, <i>Damon</i> bethought himself to ask
<i>Iris</i> a <i>Discretion</i> which he had won of her before she left the Town; and in
a <i>Billetdoux</i> to that purpose, prest her very earnestly for it. <i>Iris</i> being
infinitely pleas'd with his Importunity, suffer'd him to ask it often; and he
never fail'd of doing so.</p>

<p>But as I do not here design to relate the Adventures of these two amiable
Persons, nor to give you all the <i>Billet-doux</i> that past between them; you
shall here find nothing but the <i>Watch</i> this charming Maid sent her impatient
Lover.</p></blockquote>


<h4><i>IRIS</i> to <i>DAMON</i>.</h4>

<p>It must be confest, <i>Damon</i>, that you are the most
importuning Man in the World. Your Billets have a
hundred times demanded a <i>Discretion</i>, which you won
of me; and tell me, you will not wait my Return to be
paid. You are either a very faithless Creditor, or believe
me very unjust, that you dun with such impatience. But
to let you see that I am a Maid of Honour, and value
my Word, I will acquit my self of this Obligation I have
to you, and send you a <i>Watch</i> of my fashion; perhaps
you never saw any so good. It is not one of those that
have always something to be mended in it: but one that
is without fault, very just and good, and will remain so
as long as you continue to love me: But <i>Damon</i>, know,
the very Minute you cease to do so, the String will break,
and it will go no more. 'Tis only useful in my Absence,
and when I return 'twill change its Motion: and though
I have set it but for the Spring-time, 'twill serve you the
whole Year round: and 'twill be necessary only that you
alter the Business of the Hours (which my <i>Cupid</i>, in the
middle of my <i>Watch</i>, points you out) according to the
length of the Days and Nights. Nor is the Dart of that
little God directed to those Hours, so much to inform you
how they pass, as how you ought to pass them; how you
ought to employ those of your Absence from <i>Iris</i>. 'Tis
there you shall find the whole Business of a Lover, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
his Mistress; for I have design'd it a Rule to all your
Actions. The Consideration of the Work-man ought to
make you set a Value upon the Work: And though it be
not an accomplisht and perfect piece; yet, <i>Damon</i>, you
ought to be grateful and esteem it, since I have made it for
you alone. But however I may boast of the Design, I know,
as well as I believe you love me, that you will not suffer
me to have the Glory of it wholly, but will say in your
Heart,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>I'm charm'd with what I thither bring,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And add a Softness to the Spring.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If for Devotion I design,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love <i>meets me, even at the Shrine;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In all my Worships claims a part,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And robs even Heaven of my Heart:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>All Day does counsel aud controul,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And all the Night employs my Soul.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No wonder then if all you think be true,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That</i> Love's <i>concern'd in all I do for you.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And, <i>Damon</i>, you, know that <i>Love</i> is no ill Master;
and I must say, with a Blush, that he has found me no
unapt Scholar; and he instructs too agreeably not to succeed
in all he undertakes.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Who can resist his soft Commands?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>When he resolves, what God withstands?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But I ought to explain to you my <i>Watch</i>: The naked
<i>Love</i> which you will find in the middle of it, with his
Wings clipp'd, to shew you he is fixed and constant, and
will not fly away, points you out with his Arrow the four
and twenty Hours that compose the Day and the Night:
Over every Hour you will find written what you ought
to do, during its Course; and every Half-hour is marked
with a Sigh, since the quality of a Lover is, to sigh day
and night: Sighs are the Children of Lovers, that are
born every Hour. And that my <i>Watch</i> may always be
just, <i>Love</i> himself ought to conduct it; and your Heart
should keep time with the Movement:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>My Present's delicate and new,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>If by your Heart the Motion's set;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>According as that's false or true,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>You'll find my</i> Watch <i>will answer it.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Every Hour is tedious to a Lover separated from his
Mistress: and to shew you how good I am, I will have
my <i>Watch</i> instruct you, to pass some of them without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Inquietude; that the force of your Imagination may sometimes
charm the Trouble you have for my Absence:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Perhaps I am mistaken here,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>My Heart may too much Credit give:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But,</i> Damon, <i>you can charm my Fear,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And soon my Error undeceive.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But I will not disturb my Repose at this time with a
Jealousy, which I hope is altogether frivolous and vain;
but begin to instruct you in the Mysteries of my <i>Watch</i>.
Cast then your Eyes upon the eighth Hour in the Morning,
which is the Hour I would have you begin to wake:
you will find there written,</p>


<h3>EIGHT o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                       <i>Agreeable Reverie.</i>
</p>

<p>Do not rise yet; you may find Thoughts agreeable
enough, when you awake, to entertain you longer in Bed.
And 'tis in that Hour you ought to recollect all the
Dreams you had in the Night. If you had dream'd any
thing to my advantage, confirm your self in that thought;
but if to my disadvantage, renounce it, and disown the
injurious Dream. 'Tis in this Hour also that I give you
leave to reflect on all that I have ever said and done, that has
been most obliging to you, and that gives you the most
tender Sentiments.</p>

<p class="center">                           The Reflections.
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Remember,</i> Damon, <i>while your Mind</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Reflects on things that charm and please,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>You give me Proofs that you are kind,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And set my doubting Soul at ease:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For when your Heart receives with Joy</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>The thoughts of Favours which I give,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My Smiles in vain I not employ,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And on the Square we love and live.</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Think then on all I ever did,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>That e'er was charming, e'er was dear;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Let nothing from that Soul be hid,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Whose Griefs and Joys I feel and share.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>All that your Love and Faith have sought,</i></span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>All that your Vows and Sighs have bought,</i></span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Now render present to your Thought.</i></span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And for what's to come, I give you leave, <i>Damon</i>, to
flatter your self, and to expect, I shall still pursue those
Methods, whose Remembrance charms so well: But, if it
be possible, conceive these kind Thoughts between sleeping
and waking, that all my too forward Complaisance, my
Goodness, and my Tenderness, which I confess to have
for you, may pass for Half Dreams: for 'tis most certain,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>That tho' the Favours of the Fair</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Are ever to the Lover dear;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Yet, lest he should reproach that easy Flame,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That buys its Satisfaction with its Shame;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She ought but rarely to confess</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How much she finds of Tenderness;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nicely to guard the yielding part,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And hide the hard-kept Secret in her Heart.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For, let me tell you, <i>Damon</i>, tho' the Passion of a
Woman of Honour be ever so innocent, and the Lover
never so discreet and honest; her Heart feels I know not
what of Reproach within, at the reflection of any Favours
she has allow'd him. For my part, I never call to mind
the least soft or kind Word I have spoken to <i>Damon</i>,
without finding at the same instant my Face cover'd over
with Blushes, and my Heart with sensible Pain. I sigh
at the Remembrance of every Touch I have stolen from
his Hand, and have upbraided my Soul, which confesses
so much guilty Love, as that secret Desire of touching
him made appear. I am angry at the Discovery, though
I am pleas'd at the same time with the Satisfaction I take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in doing so; and ever disorder'd at the Remembrance of
such Arguments of too much Love. And these unquiet
Sentiments alone are sufficient to persuade me, that our
Sex cannot be reserv'd too much. And I have often, on
these occasions, said to my self,</p>

<p class="center">                             The Reserve.

<h3>TEN o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                      <i>Reading of Letters.</i>
</p>

<p>My <i>Cupid</i> points you now to the Hour in which you ought
to retire into your Cabinet, having already past an Hour
in Dressing: and for a Lover, who is sure not to appear
before his Mistress, even that Hour is too much to be so
employ'd. But I will think, you thought of nothing less
than Dressing while you were about it. Lose then no
more Minutes, but open your Scrutore, and read over
some of those Billets you have received from me. Oh!
what Pleasures a Lover feels about his Heart, in reading
those from a Mistress he entirely loves!</p>

<p class="center">                               The Joy.
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Who, but a Lover, can express</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The Joys, the Pants, the Tenderness,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That the soft amorous Soul invades,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>While the dear</i> Billetdoux <i>he reads:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Raptures Divine the Heart o'erflow,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Which he that loves not cannot know.</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A thousand Tremblings, thousand Fears,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The short-breath'd Sighs, the joyful Tears!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The Transport, where the Love's confest;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The Change, where Coldness is exprest;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The diff'ring Flames the Lover burns,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As those are shy, or kind, by turns.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>However you find'em, <i>Damon</i>, construe 'em all to my
advantage: Possibly, some of them have an Air of Coldness,
something different from that Softness they are usually
too amply fill'd with; but where you find they have,
believe there, that the Sense of Honour, and my Sex's
Modesty, guided my Hand a little against the Inclinations
of my Heart; and that it was as a kind of an Atonement,
I believed I ought to make, for something I feared I had
said too kind, and too obliging before. But where-ever
you find that Stop, that Check in my Career of Love, you
will be sure to find something that follows it to favour
you, and deny that unwilling Imposition upon my Heart;
which, lest you should mistake, Love shews himself in
Smiles again, and flatters more agreeably, disdaining the
Tyranny of Honour and rigid Custom, that Imposition
on our Sex; and will, in spite of me, let you see he
reigns absolutely in my Soul.</p>

<p>The reading my <i>Billetdoux</i> may detain you an Hour:
I have had so much Goodness to write you enow to
entertain you for so long at least, and sometimes reproach
my self for it; but, contrary to all my Scruples, I find
my self disposed to give you those frequent Marks of my
Tenderness. If yours be so great as you express it, you
ought to kiss my Letters a thousand times; you ought
to read them with Attention, and weigh every Word,
and value every Line. A Lover may receive a thousand
endearing Words from a Mistress, more easily than a
Billet. One says a great many kind things of course to
a Lover, which one is not willing to write, or to give
testify'd under one's Hand, signed and sealed. But when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
once a Lover has brought his Mistress to that degree of
Love, he ought to assure himself, she loves not at the
common rate.</p>

<p>I will not doubt, but you give credit to all that is kind
in my Letters; and I will believe, you find a Satisfaction
in the Entertainment they give you, and that the Hour
of reading 'em is not disagreeable to you. I could wish,
your Pleasure might be extreme, even to the degree of
suffering the Thought of my Absence not to diminish
any part of it. And I could wish too, at the end of your
Reading, you would sigh with Pleasure, and say to your

<p>With this little Rapture, I wish you wou'd finish the
reading my Letters, shut your Scrutore, and quit your
Cabinet; for my Love leads to eleven o'clock.</p>


<h3>ELEVEN o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                      <i>The Hour to write in.</i>
</p>

<p>If my <i>Watch</i> did not inform you 'tis now time to
write, I believe, <i>Damon</i>, your Heart wou'd, and tell you
also that I should take it kindly, if you would employ
a whole Hour that way; and that you should never lose
an Occasion of writing to me, since you are assured of the
Welcome I give your Letters. Perhaps you will say, an
Hour is too much, and that 'tis not the mode to write
long Letters. I grant you, <i>Damon</i>, when we write those
indifferent ones of Gallantry in course, or necessary Compliment;
the handsome comprizing of which in the fewest
Words, renders 'em the most agreeable: But in Love we
have a thousand foolish things to say, that of themselves
bear no great Sound, but have a mighty Sense in Love;
for there is a peculiar Eloquence natural alone to a Lover,
and to be understood by no other Creature: To those,
Words have a thousand Graces and Sweetnesses; which,
to the Unconcerned, appear Meanness, and easy Sense,
at the best. But, <i>Damon</i>, you and I are none of those ill
Judges of the Beauties of Love; we can penetrate beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the Vulgar, and perceive the fine Soul in every Line,
thro' all the humble Dress of Phrase; when possibly
they who think they discern it best in florid Language,
do not see it at all. <i>Love</i> was not born or bred in Courts,
but Cottages; and, nurs'd in Groves and Shades, smiles
on the Plains, and wantons in the Streams; all unador'd
and harmless. Therefore, <i>Damon</i>, do not consult your
Wit in this Affair, but <i>Love</i> alone; speak all that he and
Nature taught you, and let the fine Things you learn in
Schools alone: Make use of those Flowers you have
gather'd there, when you converst with States-men and
the Gown. Let <i>Iris</i> possess your Heart in all its simple
Innocence, that's the best Eloquence to her that loves:
and that is my Instruction to a Lover that would succeed
in his Amours; for I have a Heart very difficult to please,
and this is the nearest way to it.</p>

<p>It is an Art too ingenious to have been found out by
Man, and too necessary to Lovers, not to have been
invented by the God of Love himself. But, <i>Damon</i>, I do
not pretend to exact from you those Letters of Gallantry,
which, I have told you, are filled with nothing but fine
Thoughts, and writ with all the Arts of Wit and Subtilty:
I would have yours still all tender unaffected Love, Words
unchosen, Thoughts unstudied, and Love unfeign'd. I had
rather find more Softness than Wit in your Passion; more
of Nature than of Art; more of the Lover than the Poet.</p>

<p>Nor would I have you write any of those little short
Letters, that are read over in a Minute; in Love, long
Letters bring a long Pleasure: Do not trouble your self
to make 'em fine, or write a great deal of Wit and Sense
in a few Lines; that is the Notion of a witty Billet, in
any Affair but that of Love. And have a care rather to
avoid these Graces to a Mistress; and assure your self,
dear <i>Damon</i>, that what pleases the Soul pleases the Eye,
and the Largeness or Bulk of your Letter shall never
offend me; and that I only am displeased when I find
them small. A Letter is ever the best and most powerful
Agent to a Mistress, it almost always persuades, 'tis
always renewing little Impressions, that possibly otherwise
Absence would deface. Make use then, <i>Damon</i>, of your
Time while it is given you, and thank me that I permit
you to write to me: Perhaps I shall not always continue
in the Humour of suffering you to do so; and it may so
happen, by some turn of Chance and Fortune, that you
may be deprived, at the same time, both of my Presence,
and of the Means of sending to me. I will believe that
such an Accident would be a great Misfortune to you,
for I have often heard you say, that, 'To make the most
happy Lover suffer Martyrdom, one need only forbid
him Seeing, Speaking and Writing to the Object he
loves.' Take all the Advantages then you can, you
cannot give me too often Marks too powerful of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Passion: Write therefore during this Hour, every Day.
I give you leave to believe, that while you do so, you are
serving me the most obligingly and agreeably you can,
while absent; and that you are giving me a Remedy
against all Grief, Uneasiness, Melancholy, and Despair;
nay, if you exceed your Hour, you need not be asham'd.
The Time you employ in this kind Devoir, is the Time
that I shall be grateful for, and no doubt will recompense
it. You ought not however to neglect Heaven for me;
I will give you time for your Devotion, for my <i>Watch</i>
tells you 'tis time to go to the Temple.</p>


<h3>TWELVE o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                      <i>Indispensible Duty.</i>

<p>There are certain Duties which one ought never to
neglect: That of adoring the Gods is of this nature; and
which we ought to pay, from the bottom of our Hearts:
And that, <i>Damon</i>, is the only time I will dispense with
your not thinking on me. But I would not have you go
to one of those Temples, where the celebrated Beauties,
and those that make a profession of Gallantry, go; and
who come thither only to see, and be seen; and whither
they repair, more to shew their Beauty and Dress, than
to honour the Gods. If you will take my advice, and
oblige my wish, you shall go to those that are least
frequented, and you shall appear there like a Man that
has a perfect Veneration for all things Sacred.</p>

<p>I Perceive it will be very difficult for you to quit the
Temple, without being surrounded with Compliments
from People of Ceremony, Friends, and Newsmongers,
and several of those sorts of Persons, who afflict and busy
themselves, and rejoice at a hundred things they have no
Interest in; Coquets and Politicians, who make it the
Business of their whole Lives, to gather all the News of
the Town; adding or diminishing according to the Stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of their Wit and Invention, and spreading it all abroad
to the believing Fools and Gossips; and perplexing every
body with a hundred ridiculous Novels, which they pass
off for Wit and Entertainment; or else some of those
Recounters of Adventures, that are always telling of
Intrigues, and that make a Secret to a hundred People of
a thousand foolish things they have heard: Like a certain
pert and impertinent Lady of the Town, whose Youth
and Beauty being past, sets up for Wit, to uphold a feeble
Empire over idle Hearts; and whose Character is this:</p>

<p>This sort of Creature, <i>Damon</i>, is very dangerous; not that
I fear you will squander away a Heart upon her, but your
Hours; for in spight of you, she'll detain you with a thousand
Impertinencies, and eternal Tattle. She passes for a judging
Wit; and there is nothing so troublesome as such a Pretender.
She, perhaps, may get some knowledge of our
Correspondence; and then, no doubt, will improve it to
my Disadvantage. Possibly she may rail at me; that is
her fashion by the way of friendly Speaking; and an
aukward Commendation, the most effectual way of Defaming
and Traducing. Perhaps she tells you, in a cold
Tone, that you are a happy Man to be belov'd by me:
That <i>Iris</i> indeed is handsome, and she wonders she has
no more Lovers; but the Men are not of her mind; if
they were, you should have more Rivals. She commends
my Face, but that I have blue Eyes, and 'tis pity my Complexion
is no better: My Shape but too much inclining
to fat. Cries&mdash;She would charm infinitely with her Wit,
but that she knows too well she is Mistress of it. And
concludes,&mdash;But all together she is well enough.&mdash;Thus she
runs on without giving you leave to edge in a word in my
defence; and ever and anon crying up her own Conduct
and Management: Tells you how she is opprest with
Lovers, and fatigu'd with Addresses; and recommending
her self, at every turn, with a perceivable Cunning: And
all the while is jilting you of your good Opinion; which
she would buy at the price of any body's Repose, or
her own Fame, tho' but for the Vanity of adding to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the number of her Lovers. When she sees a new Spark,
the first thing she does, she enquires into his Estate; if she
find it such as may (if the Coxcomb be well manag'd)
supply her Vanity, she makes advances to him, and applies
her self to those little Arts she usually makes use of to gain
her Fools; and according to his Humour dresses and affects
her own. But, <i>Damon</i>, since I point to no particular Person
in this Character, I will not name who you shall avoid;
but all of this sort I conjure you, wheresoever you find 'em.
But if unlucky Chance throw you in their way, hear all
they say, without credit or regard, as far as Decency will
suffer you; hear 'em without approving their Foppery;
and hear 'em without giving 'em cause to censure you.
But 'tis so much Time lost to listen to all the Novels this
sort of People will perplex you with; whose Business is to
be idle, and who even tire themselves with their own Impertinencies.
And be assur'd after all there is nothing they
can tell you that is worth your knowing. And <i>Damon</i>,
a perfect Lover never asks any News but of the Maid he
loves.</p>

<h3>TWO o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                          <i>Dinner-Time.</i>
</p>

<p>Leave all those fond Entertainments, or you will disoblige
me, and make Dinner wait for you; for my <i>Cupid</i> tells you
'tis that Hour. <i>Love</i> does not pretend to make you lose
that; nor is it my Province to order you your Diet. Here
I give you a perfect Liberty to do what you please; and
possibly, 'tis the only Hour in the whole four and twenty
that I will absolutely resign you, or dispense with your
even so much as thinking on me. 'Tis true, in seating
your self at Table, I would not have you placed over-against
a very beautiful Object; for in such a one there are
a thousand little Graces in Speaking, Looking, and Laughing
that fail not to charm, if one gives way to the Eyes,
to gaze and wander that way; in which, perhaps, in spight
of you, you will find a Pleasure: And while you do so,
tho' without design or concern, you give the fair
Charmer a sort of Vanity, in believing you have placed
your self there, only for the advantage of looking on her;
and she assumes a hundred little Graces and Affectations
which are not natural to her, to compleat a Conquest, which
she believes so well begun already. She softens her Eyes,
and sweetens her Mouth; and in fine, puts on another Air
than when she had no Design, and when you did not, by
your continual looking on her, rouze her Vanity, and
encrease her easy Opinion of her own Charms. Perhaps
she knows I have some Interest in your Heart, and prides
her self, at least, with believing she has attracted the Eyes
of my Lover, if not his Heart; and thinks it easy to vanquish
the whole, if she pleases; and triumphs over me in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
secret Imaginations. Remember, <i>Damon</i>, that while you
act thus in the Company and Conversation of other
Beauties, every Look or Word you give in favour of 'em,
is an Indignity to my Reputation; and which you cannot
suffer if you love me truly, and with Honour: and assure
your self, so much Vanity as you inspire in her, so much
Fame you rob me of; for whatever Praises you give another
Beauty, so much you take away from mine. Therefore,
if you dine in Company, do as others do: Be generally
civil, not applying your self by Words or Looks to any
particular Person: Be as gay as you please: Talk and laugh
with all, for this is not the Hour for Chagrin.</p>

<h3>THREE o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                       <i>Visits to Friends.</i>
</p>

<p>Damon, my <i>Watch</i> is juster than you imagine; it would
not have you live retired and solitary, but permits you to
go and make Visits. I am not one of those that believe
Love and Friendship cannot find a place in one and the
same Heart: And that Man would be very unhappy, who,
as soon as he had a Mistress, should be obliged to renounce
the Society of his Friends. I must confess, I would not that
you should have so much Concern for them, as you have for
me; for I have heard a sort of a Proverb that says, <i>He cannot
be very fervent in Love, who is not a little cold in Friendship.</i>
You are not ignorant, that when <i>Love</i> establishes himself in
a Heart, he reigns a Tyrant there, and will not suffer even
Friendship, if it pretend to share his Empire there.</p>

<p class="center">                                Cupid.
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love <i>is a God, whose charming Sway</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Both Heaven, and Earth, and Seas obey;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A Power that will not mingled be</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With any dull Equality.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Since first from Heaven, which gave him Birth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He rul'd the Empire of the Earth;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Jealous of Sov'reign Pow'r he rules,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And will be absolute in Souls.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I should be very angry if you had any of those Friendships
which one ought to desire in a Mistress only; for
many times it happens that you have Sentiments a little too
tender for those amiable Persons; and many times Love
and Friendship are so confounded together, that one cannot
easily discern one from the other. I have seen a Man flatter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
himself with an Opinion, that he had but an Esteem for
a Woman, when by some turn of Fortune in her Life, as
marrying, or receiving the Addresses of Men, he has found
by Spite and Jealousies within, that that was Love, which
he before took for Complaisance or Friendship. Therefore
have a care, for such Amities are dangerous: Not but that
a Lover may have fair and generous Female Friends, whom
he ought to visit; and perhaps I should esteem you less, if
I did not believe you were valued by such, if I were perfectly
assured they were Friends and not Lovers. But have
a care you hide not a Mistress under this Veil, or that you
gain not a Lover by this Pretence: For you may begin with
Friendship, and end with Love; and I should be equally
afflicted should you give it or receive it. And though you
charge our Sex with all the Vanity, yet I often find Nature
to have given you as large a Portion of that common Crime,
which you would shuffle off, as asham'd to own; and are
as fond and vain of the Imagination of a Conquest, as any
<i>Coquet</i> of us all: tho' at the same time you despise the
Victim, you think it adds a Trophy to your Fame. And I
have seen a Man dress, and trick, and adjust his Looks and
Mein, to make a Visit to a Woman he lov'd not, nor ever
could love, as for those he made to his Mistress; and only
for the Vanity of making a Conquest upon a Heart, even
unworthy of the little Pains he has taken about it. And what
is this but buying Vanity at the Expense of Sense and Ease;
and with Fatigue to purchase the Name of a conceited Fop,
besides that of a dishonest Man? For he who takes pains
to make himself beloved, only to please his curious Humour,
tho' he should say nothing that tends to it, more than
by his Looks, his Sighs, and now and then breaking into
Praises and Commendations of the Object; by the care he
takes, to appear well drest before her, and in good order;
he lyes in his Looks, he deceives with his Mein and Fashion,
and cheats with every Motion, and every Grace he puts on:
He cozens when he sings or dances; he dissembles when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
he sighs; and every thing he does, that wilfully gains upon
her, is Malice prepense, Baseness, and Art below a Man
of Sense or Virtue: and yet these Arts, these Cozenages,
are the Common Practices of the Town. What's this but
that damnable Vice, of which they so reproach our Sex;
that of jilting for Hearts? And 'tis in vain that my Lover,
after such foul Play, shall think to appease me, with saying,
<i>He did it to try how easy he could conquer, and of how great
force his Charms were: And why should I be angry if all the
Town loved him, since he loved none but</i> Iris? Oh foolish
Pleasure! How little Sense goes to the making of such
a Happiness! And how little Love must he have for one
particular Person, who would wish to inspire it into all the
World, and yet himself pretend to be insensible! But this,
<i>Damon</i>, is rather what is but too much practiced by your
Sex, than any Guilt I charge on you: tho' Vanity be
an Ingredient that Nature very seldom omits in the Composition
of either Sex; and you may be allowed a Tincture
of it at least. And, perhaps, I am not wholly exempt from
this Leaven in my Nature, but accuse myself sometimes of
finding a secret Joy of being ador'd, tho' I even hate my
Worshipper. But if any such Pleasure touch my Heart,
I find it at the same time blushing in my Cheeks with
a guilty Shame, which soon checks the petty Triumphs;
and I have a Virtue at soberer Thoughts, that I find surmounts
my Weakness and Indiscretion; and I hope <i>Damon</i>
finds the same: For, should he have any of those Attachments,
I should have no pity for him.</p>

<h3>FOUR o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                      <i>General Conversation.</i>
</p>

<p>In this Visiting-Hour, many People will happen to meet
at one and the same Time together, in a Place: And as you
make not Visits to Friends, to be silent, you ought to enter
into Conversation with 'em; but those Conversations ought
to be general, and of general things: for there is no necessity
of making your Friend the Confident of your Amours.
'Twould infinitely displease me, to hear you have reveal'd
to them all that I have repos'd in you; tho' Secrets never
so trivial, yet since utter'd between Lovers, they deserve to
be priz'd at a higher rate: For what can shew a Heart more
indifferent and indiscreet, than to declare in any fashion, or
with Mirth, or Joy, the tender things a Mistress says to
a Lover, and which possibly, related at second hand, bear
not the same Sense, because they have not the same Sound
and Air they had originally, when they came from the soft
Heart of her, who sigh'd 'em first to her lavish Lover?
Perhaps they are told again with Mirth, or Joy, unbecoming
their Character and Business; and then they lose their
Graces: (for Love is the most solemn thing in nature, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the most unsuiting with Gaiety.) Perhaps the soft Expressions
suit not so well the harsher Voice of the masculine
Lover, whose Accents were not form'd for so much Tenderness;
at least, not of that sort: for Words that have the
same Meaning, are alter'd from their Sense by the least
tone or accent of the Voice; and those proper and fitted
to my Soul, are not, possibly, so to yours, though both have
the same Efficacy upon us; yours upon my Heart, as mine
upon yours: and both will be misunderstood by the unjudging
World. Beside this, there is a Holiness in Love
that's true, that ought not to be profan'd: And as the Poet
truly says, at the latter end of an Ode, of which I will recite
the whole;</p>

<p>There is nothing more true than those two last Lines:
and that Love ceases to be a Pleasure, when it ceases to
be a Secret, and one you ought to keep sacred: For the
World, which never makes a right Judgment of things,
will misinterpret Love, as they do Religion; every one
judging it, according to the Notion he has of it, or the
Talent of his Sense. <i>Love</i> (as a great Duke said) <i>is like
Apparitions; every one talks of them, but few have seen 'em</i>:
Every body thinks himself capable of understanding Love,
and that he is a Master in the Art of it; when there is
nothing so nice, or difficult, to be rightly comprehended;
and indeed cannot be, but to a Soul very delicate. Nor
will he make himself known to the Vulgar: There must
be an uncommon Fineness in the Mind that contains
him; the rest he only visits in as many Disguises as there
are Dispositions and Natures, where he makes but a short
stay, and is gone. He can fit himself to all Hearts, being
the greatest Flatterer in the World: And he possesses
every one with a Confidence, that they are in the number
of his Elect; and they think they know him perfectly,
when nothing but the Spirits refined possess him in his
Excellency. From this difference of Love, in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Souls, proceed those odd fantastick Maxims, which so
many hold of so different kinds: And this makes the most
innocent Pleasures pass oftentimes for Crimes, with the
unjudging Croud, who call themselves Lovers: And you
will have your Passion censur'd by as many as you shall
discover it to, and as many several ways. I advise you
therefore, <i>Damon</i>, to make no Confidents of your Amours;
and believe, that Silence has, with me, the most powerful
Charm.</p>

<p>'Tis also in these Conversations, that those indiscreetly
civil Persons often are, who think to oblige a good Man,
by letting him know he is belov'd by some one or other;
and making him understand how many good Qualities
he is Master of, to render him agreeable to the Fair Sex,
if he would but advance where Love and good Fortune
call; and that a too constant Lover loses a great part of
his Time, which might be manag'd to more advantage,
since Youth hath so short a Race to run. This, and
a thousand the like indecent Complaisances, give him
a Vanity that suits not with that Discretion, which has
hitherto acquir'd him so good a Reputation. I would
not have you, <i>Damon</i>, act on these occasions, as many of
the easy Sparks have done before you, who receive such
Weakness and Flattery for Truth; and passing it off with
a Smile, suffer 'em to advance in Folly, till they have gain'd
a Credit with 'em, and they believe all they hear; telling
'em they do so, by consenting Gestures, Silence, or open
Approbation. For my part, I should not condemn a Lover
that should answer such a sort of civil Brokers for Love,
somewhat briskly; and by giving 'em to understand they
are already engag'd, or directing 'em to Fools, that will
possibly hearken to 'em, and credit such Stuff, shame 'em
out of a Folly so infamous and disingenuous. In such
a Case only I am willing you should own your Passion;
not that you need tell the Object which has charm'd you:
And you may say, you are already a Lover, without saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
you are belov'd. For so long as you appear to have a
Heart unengag'd, you are expos'd to all the little Arts and
and Addresses of this sort of obliging Procurers of Love,
and give way to the hope they have of making you their
Proselyte. For your own Reputation then, and my Ease
and Honour, shun such Conversations; for they are neither
creditable to you, nor pleasing to me: And believe me,
<i>Damon</i>, a true Lover has no Curiosity, but what concerns
his Mistress.</p>

<p class="center">                       <i>Dangerous Visits.</i>
</p>

<p>I foresee, or fear, that these busy impertinent Friends
will oblige you to visit some Ladies of their Acquaintance,
or yours; my <i>Watch</i> does not forbid you. Yet I must
tell you, I apprehend Danger in such Visits; and I fear,
you will have need of all your Care and Precaution, in
these Encounters. That you may give me no cause to
suspect you, perhaps you will argue, that Civility obliges
you to it. If I were assur'd there would no other Design
be carried on, I should believe it were to advance an
amorous Prudence too far, to forbid you. Only keep
yourself upon your guard; for the Business of most part
of the Fair Sex, is, to seek only the Conquest of Hearts:
All their Civilities are but so many Interests; and they
do nothing without Design. And in such Conversations
there is always a <i>Je ne scay quoy</i>, that is fear'd, especially
when Beauty is accompanied with Youth and Gaiety;
and which they assume upon all occasions that may serve
their turn. And I confess, 'tis not an easy matter to be
just in these Hours and Conversations: The most certain
way of being so, is to imagine I read all your Thoughts,
observe all your Looks, and hear all your Words.</p>

<p>But, <i>Damon</i>, I know all Lovers are naturally Flatterers,
tho' they do not think so themselves; because every one
makes a Sense of Beauty according to his own Fancy.
But perhaps you will say in your own defence, That
'tis not Flattery to say an unbeautiful Woman is beautiful,
if he that says so believes she is so. I should be
content to acquit you of the first, provided you allow me
the last: And if I appear charming in <i>Damon's</i> eyes, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
not fond of the Approbation of any other. 'Tis enough
the World thinks me not altogether disagreeable, to justify
his Choice; but let your good Opinion give what Increase
it pleases to my Beauty, tho' your Approbation give me
a Pleasure, it shall not a Vanity; and I am contented
that <i>Damon</i> should think me a Beauty, without my believing
I am one. 'Tis not to draw new Assurances, and
new Vows from you, that I speak this; though Tales of
Love are the only ones we desire to hear often told, and
which never tire the Hearers if addrest to themselves. But
'tis not to this end I now seem to doubt what you say to
my advantage: No, my Heart knows no Disguise, nor can
dissemble one Thought of it to <i>Damon</i>; 'tis all sincere, and
honest as his Wish: 'Tis therefore it tells you, it does not
credit every thing you say; tho' I believe you say abundance
of Truths in a great part of my Character. But when you
advance to that, which my own Sense, my Judgment, or my
Glass cannot persuade me to believe, you must give me leave
either to believe you think me vain enough to credit you,
or pleas'd that your Sentiments and mine are differing in
this point. But I doubt I may rather reply in some Verses,
a Friend of yours and mine sent to a Person she thought
had but indifferent Sentiments for her; yet, who nevertheless
flatter'd her, because he imagin'd she had a very great
Esteem for him. She is a Woman that, you know, naturally
hates Flattery: On the other side she was extremely dissatisfy'd,
and uneasy at his Opinion of his being more in
her favour than she desir'd he should believe. So that one
Night having left her full of Pride and Anger, she next
Morning sent him these Verses, instead of a <i>Billetdoux</i>.</p>

<p>Possibly, the angry <i>Aminta</i>, when she writ these Verses,
was more offended, that he believed himself belov'd, than
that he flatter'd; tho' she wou'd seem to make that a
great part of the Quarrel, and Cause of her Resentment:
For we are often in an humour to seem more modest in
that point, than naturally we are; being too apt to have
a favourable Opinion of our selves: And 'tis rather the
Effects of a Fear that we are flatter'd, than our own ill
Opinion of the Beauty flatter'd; and that the Praiser
thinks not so well of it, as we do our selves, or at least we
wish he should. Not but there are Grains of Allowance
for the Temper of him that speaks: One Man's Humour
is to talk much; and he may be permitted to enlarge
upon the Praise he gives the Person he pretends to,
without being accus'd of much Guilt. Another hates to
be wordy; from such an one, I have known one soft
Expression, one tender Thing, go as far as whole Days
everlasting Protestations urged with Vows, and mighty
Eloquence. And both the one and the other, indeed,
must be allow'd in good manners, to stretch the Compliment
beyond the bounds of nice Truth: and we must
not wonder to hear a Man call a Woman a Beauty, when
she is not ugly; or another a great Wit, if she have but
common Sense above the Vulgar; well bred, when well
drest; and good-natur'd, when civil. And as I should
be very ridiculous, if I took all you said for absolute
Truth; so I should be very unjust, not to allow you very
sincere in almost all you said besides; and those things,
the most material to Love, Honour and Friendship. And
for the rest (<i>Damon</i>) be it true or false, this believe, you
speak with such a Grace, that I cannot chuse but credit
you; and find an infinite Pleasure in that Faith, because
I love you: And if I cannot find the Cheat, I am contented
you should deceive me on, because you do it so
agreeably.</p>

all the young Beauties love those Places too well, not to
be there. 'Tis there that a thousand Intrigues are carry'd
on, and as many more design'd: 'Tis there that every
one is set out for Conquest; and who aim at nothing less
than Hearts. Guard yours well, my <i>Damon</i>; and be not
always admiring what you see. Do not, in passing by,
sigh them silent Praises. Suffer not so much as a guilty
Wish to approach your Thoughts, nor a heedful Glance
to steal from your fine Eyes: Those are Regards you
ought only to have for her you love. But oh! above all,
have a care of what you say: You are not reproachable,
if you should remain silent all the time of your Walk;
nor would those that know you believe it the Effects of
Dulness, but Melancholy. And if any of your Friends
ask you, Why you are so? I will give you leave to sigh,

<p>I do not, for all this, wholly confine your Eyes: you
may look indifferently on all, but with a particular regard
on none. You may praise all the Beauties in general,
but no single one too much. I will not exact from you
neither an intire Silence: There are a thousand Civilities
you ought to pay to all your Friends and Acquaintance;
and while I caution you of Actions, that may get you the
Reputation of a Lover of some of the Fair that haunt
those Places, I would not have you, by an unnecessary
and uncomplaisant Sullenness, gain that of a Person too
negligent or morose. I would have you remiss in no one
<i>Punctilio</i> of good Manners. I would have you very just,
and pay all you owe; but in these Affairs be not over
generous, and give away too much. In fine, you may
look, speak and walk; but (<i>Damon</i>) do it all without
design: And while you do so, remember that <i>Iris</i> sent
you this Advice.</p>

<h3>SEVEN o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                       <i>Voluntary Retreat.</i>
</p>

<p>'Tis time to be weary, 'tis Night: Take leave of your
Friends and retire home. 'Tis in this Retreat that you
ought to recollect in your Thoughts all the Actions of
the Day, and all those things that you ought to give me
an account of, in your Letter: You cannot hide the least
Secret from me, without Treason against sacred Love.
For all the World agrees that Confidence is one of the
greatest Proofs of the Passion of Love; and that Lover
who refuses his Confidence to the Person he loves, is to
be suspected to love but very indifferently, and to think
very poorly of the Sense and Generosity of his Mistress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
But that you may acquit your self like a Man, and a
Lover of Honour, and leave me no doubt upon my Soul;
think of all you have done this day, that I may have all
the Story of it in your next Letter to me: but deal
faithfully, and neither add nor diminish in your Relation;
the Truth and Sincerity of your Confession will atone
even for little Faults that you shall commit against me,
in some of those things you shall tell me. For if you
have fail'd in any Point or Circumstance of Love, I had
much rather hear it from you than another: for 'tis a sort
of Repentance to accuse your self; and would be a Crime
unpardonable, if you suffer me to hear it from any other:
And be assur'd, while you confess it, I shall be indulgent
enough to forgive you. The noblest Quality of Man is
Sincerity; and (<i>Damon</i>) one ought to have as much of
it in Love, as in any other Business of one's Life, notwithstanding
the most part of Men make no account of
it there; but will believe there ought to be Double-dealing,
and an Art practised in Love as well as in War.
But, Oh! beware of that Notion.</p>

<p class="center">                              Sincerity.

<p>After you have sufficiently recollected your self of all the
past Actions of the Day, call your Page into your Cabinet,
or him whom you trusted with your last Letter to me; where
you ought to enquire of him a thousand things, and all of
me. Ask impatiently, and be angry if he answers not
your Curiosity soon enough: Think that he has a dreaming
in his Voice, in these moments more than at other
times; and reproach him with Dulness: For 'tis most
certain that when one loves tenderly, we would know in a
minute, what cannot be related in an hour. Ask him,
How I did? How I receiv'd his Letter? And if he
examined the Air of my Face, when I took it? If I blush'd
or looked pale? If my Hand trembled, or I spoke to him
with short interrupting Sighs? If I asked him any Questions
about you, while I was opening the Seal? Or if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
I could not well speak, and was silent? If I read it attentively,
and with Joy? And all this, before you open the
Answer I have sent you by him: which, because you are
impatient to read, you, with the more haste and earnestness,
demand all you expect from him; and that you may
the better know what Humour I was in, when I writ
that to you: For, Oh! a Lover has a thousand little
Fears, and Dreads, he knows not why. In fine, make
him recount to you all that past, while he was with me;
and then you ought to read that which I have sent, that
you may inform your self of all that passes in my Heart:
for you may assure your self, all that I say to you that
way proceeds from thence.</p>

<h3>NINE o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                     <i>Melancholy Reflections.</i>
</p>

<p>You will not have much trouble to explain what my
<i>Watch</i> designs here. There can be no Thought more
afflicting, than that of the Absence of a Mistress; and
which the Sighings of the Heart will soon make you find.
Ten thousand Fears oppress him; he is jealous of every
body, and envies those Eyes and Ears that are charmed
by being near the Object ador'd. He grows impatient,
and makes a thousand Resolutions, and as soon abandons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
them all. He gives himself wholly up to the Torment
of Incertainty; and by degrees, from one cruel Thought
to another, winds himself up to insupportable Chagrin.
Take this Hour then, to think on your Misfortunes,
which cannot be small to a Soul that is wholly sensible of
Love. And every one knows, that a Lover, deprived of
the Object of his Heart, is deprived of all the World, and
inconsolable: For tho' one wishes without ceasing for the
dear Charmer one loves, and tho' you speak of her every
minute; and tho' you are writing to her every day, and tho'
you are infinitely pleas'd with the dear and tender Answers;
yet, to speak sincerely, it must be confessed, that the
Felicity of a true Lover is to be always near his Mistress.
And you may tell me, O <i>Damon</i>! what you please; and
say that Absence inspires the Flame, which perpetual
Presence would satiate: I love too well to be of that
mind, and when I am, I shall believe my Passion is
declining. I know not whether it advances your Love;
but surely it must ruin your Repose: And it is impossible
to be, at once, an absent Lover, and happy too. For my
part, I can meet with nothing that can please in the
absence of <i>Damon</i>; but on the contrary I see all things
with disgust. I will flatter my self, that 'tis so with you;
and that the least Evils appear great Misfortunes; and
that all those who speak to you of any thing but of what
you love, increase your Pain, by a new remembrance of
her Absence. I will believe that these are your Sentiments,
when you are assur'd not to see me in some weeks;
and if your Heart do not betray your Words, all those
days will be tedious to you. I would not, however, have
your Melancholy too extreme; and to lessen it, you may
persuade your self, that I partake it with you: for, I
remember, in your last you told me, you would wish we
should be both griev'd at the same time, and both at
the same time pleas'd; and I believe I love too well not
to obey you.</p>

<h3>TEN o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                          <i>Reflections.</i>
</p>

<p>After the afflicting Thoughts of my Absence, make
some Reflections on your Happiness. Think it a Blessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
to be permitted to love me; think it so, because I permit
it to you alone, and never could be drawn to allow it any
other. The first thing you ought to consider, is, that at
length I have suffer'd my self to be overcome, to quit that
Nicety that is natural to me, and receive your Addresses;
nay, thought 'em agreeable: and that I have at last confess'd,
the Present of your Heart is very dear to me. 'Tis
true, I did not accept of it the first time it was offer'd
me, nor before you had told me a thousand times, that
you could not escape expiring, if I did not give you leave to
sigh for me, and gaze upon me; and that there was an
absolute necessity for me, either to give you leave to love,
or die. And all those Rigours my Severity has made you
suffer, ought now to be recounted to your Memory, as
Subjects of Pleasure; and you ought to esteem and judge
of the Price of my Affections, by the Difficulties you found
in being able to touch my Heart: Not but you have
Charms that can conquer at first sight; and you ought not
to have valu'd me less, if I had been more easily gain'd: But
'tis enough to please you, to think and know I am gain'd;
no matter when and how. When, after a thousand Cares
and Inquietudes, that which we wish for succeeds to our
Desires, the remembrance of those Pains and Pleasures we
encounter'd in arriving at it, gives us a new Joy.</p>

<p>Remember also, <i>Damon</i>, that I have preferred you
before all those that have been thought worthy of my
Esteem; and that I have shut my Eyes to all their pleading
Merits, and could survey none but yours.</p>

<p>Consider then, that you had not only the Happiness to
please me, but that you only found out the way of doing
it, and I had the Goodness at last to tell you so, contrary
to all the Delicacy and Niceness of my Soul, contrary to
my Prudence, and all those Scruples, you know, are
natural to my Humour.</p>

<p>My Tenderness proceeded further, and I gave you
innocent Marks of my new-born Passion, on all occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
that presented themselves: For, after that from my Eyes
and Tongue you knew the Sentiments of my Heart, I
confirm'd that Truth to you by my Letters. Confess,
<i>Damon</i>, that if you make these Reflections, you will not
pass this Hour very disagreeably.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>That could inspire the tender Wound,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>I trembled when my Hand you press'd,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Nor cou'd my Guilt controul;</i><br /></span>

<span class="i2"><i>Too poorly understood:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I gave my Soul the noblest way,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>My Letters made it good.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You may believe I did not easily, nor suddenly, bring
my Heart to this Condescension; but I lov'd, and all
things in <i>Damon</i> were capable of making me resolve so to
do. I could not think it a Crime, where every Grace,
and every Virtue justified my Choice: And when once
one is assured of this, we find not much difficulty in
owning that Passion which will so well commend one's
Judgment; and there is no Obstacle that Love does not
surmount. I confess'd my Weakness a thousand ways,
before I told it you; and I remember all those things
with Pleasure, but yet I remember 'em also with Shame.</p>


<h3>ELEVEN o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                             <i>Supper.</i>
</p>

<p>I Will believe, <i>Damon</i>, that you have been so well
entertained during this Hour, and have found so much
Sweetness in these Thoughts, that if one did not tell you
that Supper waits, you would lose your self in Reflections
so pleasing, many more Minutes. But you must go where
you are expected; perhaps, among the fair, the young,
the gay; but do not abandon your Heart to too much
Joy, tho' you have so much reason to be contented: but
the greatest Pleasures are always imperfect, if the Object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
belov'd do not partake of it. For this reason be chearful
and merry with reserve: Do not talk too much, I know
you do not love it; and if you do it, 'twill be the effect
of too much Complaisance, or with some design of pleasing
too well; for you know your own charming Power, and
how agreeable your Wit and Conversation are to all the
World. Remember, I am covetous of every Word you
speak, that is not address'd to me, and envy the happy
list'ner, if I am not by. And I may reply to you as
<i>Aminta</i> did to <i>Philander</i>, when he charged her of loving
a Talker: and because, perhaps, you have not heard it,
I will, to divert you, send it to you; and at the same time
assure you, <i>Damon</i>, that your more noble Quality, of
speaking little, has reduc'd me to a perfect Abhorrence of
those wordy Sparks, that value themselves upon their
ready and much talking upon every trivial Subject, and
who have so good an Opinion of their Talent that way,
they will let no body edge in a word, or a reply; but will
make all the Conversation themselves, that they may pass
for very entertaining Persons, and pure Company. But

<span class="i0"><i>Let the dull World henceforth to Words be damn'd;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I'm into nobler Sense than Talking sham'd.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I believe you are so good a Lover, as to be of my
Opinion; and that you will neither force your self against
Nature, nor find much occasion to lavish out those excellent
things that must proceed from you, whenever you
speak. If all Women were like me, I should have more
reason to fear your Silence than your Talk: for you have
a thousand ways to charm without speaking, and those
which to me shew a great deal more Concern. But,
<i>Damon</i>, you know the greatest part of my Sex judge the
fine Gentleman by the Volubility of his Tongue, by his
Dexterity in Repartee, and cry&mdash;<i>Oh! he never wants fine
things to say: He's eternally talking the most surprizing
things.</i> But, <i>Damon</i>, you are well assur'd, I hope, that
<i>Iris</i> is none of these <i>Coquets</i>: at least, if she had any spark
of it once in her Nature, she is by the excellency of your
contrary Temper taught to know, and scorn the folly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
And take heed your Conduct never give me cause to
suspect you have deceiv'd me in your Temper.</p>


<h3>TWELVE o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                         <i>Complaisance.</i>
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, <i>Damon</i>, Civility requires a little Complaisance
after Supper; and I am assur'd, you can never
want that, tho' I confess, you are not accus'd of too general
a Complaisance, and do not often make use of it to those
Persons you have an Indifference for: tho' one is not the
less esteemable for having more of this than one ought:
and tho' an excess of it be a Fault, 'tis a very excusable
one. Have therefore some for those with whom you are:
You may laugh with 'em, drink with 'em, dance or sing
with 'em; yet think of me. You may discourse of a thousand
indifferent things with 'em; and at the same time
still think of me. If the Subject be any beautiful Lady,
whom they praise, either for her Person, Wit, or Virtue,
you may apply it to me: And if you dare not say it aloud,
at least, let your Heart answer in this language:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Yes, the fair Object, whom you praise,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Can give us Love a thousand ways;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Her Wit and Beauty charming are;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But still my</i> Iris <i>is more fair.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No body ever spoke before me of a faithful Lover, but
still I sigh'd, and thought of <i>Damon</i>: And ever when they
tell me Tales of Love, any soft pleasing Intercourses of an
Amour; Oh! with what Pleasures do I listen! and with
Pleasure answer 'em, either with my Eyes, or Tongue&mdash;</p>

<p>If I have not all those excellent Qualities you meet with
in those beautiful People, I am however very glad that
Love prepossesses your Heart to my advantage: And I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
need not tell you, <i>Damon</i>, that a true Lover ought to persuade
himself, that all other Objects ought to give place
to her, for whom his Heart sighs&mdash;But see, my <i>Cupid</i> tells
you 'tis One o'Clock, and that you ought not to be longer
from your Apartment; where, while you are undressing,

<h3>ONE o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                     <i>Impossibility to Sleep.</i>
</p>

<p>You have been up long enough; and <i>Cupid</i>, who takes
care of your Health, tells you, 'tis time for you to go to
bed. Perhaps you may not sleep as soon as you are laid,
and possibly you may pass an Hour in Bed, before you
shut your Eyes. In this impossibility of sleeping, I think
it very proper for you to imagine what I am doing where
I am. Let your Fancy take a little Journey then, invisible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to observe my Actions and my Conduct. You will find
me sitting alone in my Cabinet (for I am one that do
not love to go to bed early) and will find me very uneasy
and pensive, pleas'd with none of those things that so well
entertain others. I shun all Conversation, as far as Civility
will allow, and find no Satisfaction like being alone, where
my Soul may, without interruption, converse with <i>Damon</i>.
I sigh, and sometimes you will see my Cheeks wet with
Tears, that insensibly glide down at a thousand Thoughts
that present themselves soft and afflicting. I partake of
all your Inquietude. On other things I think with indifference,
if ever my Thoughts do stray from the more
agreeable Object. I find, however, a little Sweetness in
this Thought, that, during my Absence, your Heart thinks
of me, when mine sighs for you. Perhaps I am mistaken,
and that at the same time that you are the Entertainment
of all my Thoughts, I am no more in yours; and perhaps
you are thinking of those things that immortalize the
Young and Brave, either by those Glories the Muses
flatter you with, or that of <i>Bellona</i>, and the God of War;
and serving now a Monarch, whose glorious Acts in Arms
has out-gone all the feign'd and real Heroes of any Age,
who has, himself, out-done whatever History can produce
of great and brave, and set so illustrious an Example to the
Under-World, that it is not impossible, as much a Lover
as you are, but you are thinking now how to render your
self worthy the Glory of such a God-like Master, by
projecting a thousand things of Gallantry and Danger.
And tho', I confess, such Thoughts are proper for your
Youth, your Quality, and the Place you have the honour
to hold under our Sovereign, yet let me tell you, <i>Damon</i>,
you will not be without Inquietude, if you think of either
being a delicate Poet, or a brave Warrior; for <i>Love</i> will
still interrupt your Glory, however you may think to
divert him either by writing or fighting. And you ought
to remember these Verses:</p>

Beds, they are much better Days than in the Campagne.
Nor do the Crowns of Glory surpass those of Love: The
first is but an empty Name, which is won, kept and lost
with Hazard; but Love more nobly employs a brave Soul,
and all his Pleasures are solid and lasting; and when one
has a worthy Object of one's Flame, Glory accompanies
Love too. But go to sleep, the Hour is come; and 'tis
now that your Soul ought to be entertain'd in Dreams.</p>


<h3>TWO o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                     <i>Conversation in Dreams.</i>
</p>

<p>I doubt not but you will think it very bold and arbitrary,
that my <i>Watch</i> should pretend to rule even your sleeping
Hours, and that my <i>Cupid</i> should govern your very Dreams;
which are but Thoughts disordered, in which Reason has
no part; Chimera's of the Imagination, and no more. But
tho' my <i>Watch</i> does not pretend to Counsel unreasonably,
yet you must allow it here, if not to pass the Bounds, at
least to advance to the utmost Limits of it. I am assur'd,
that after having thought so much of me in the Day, you
will think of me also in the Night. And the first Dream
my <i>Watch</i> permits you to make, is to think you are in
Conversation with me.</p>

<p>Imagine, <i>Damon</i>, that you are talking to me of your
Passion, with all the Transport of a Lover, and that I hear
you with Satisfaction; that all my Looks and Blushes,
while you are speaking, give you new Hopes and Assurances;
that you are not indifferent to me; and that I give
you a thousand Testimonies of my Tenderness, all innocent
and obliging.</p>

<p>While you are saying all that Love can dictate, all that
Wit and good Manners can invent, and all that I wish to
hear from <i>Damon</i>, believe in this Dream, all flattering and
dear, that after having shewed me the Ardour of your
Flame, I confess to you the Bottom of my Heart, and all
the loving Secrets there; that I give you Sigh for Sigh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Tenderness for Tenderness, Heart for Heart, and Pleasure
for Pleasure. And I would have your Sense of this Dream
so perfect, and your Joy so entire, that if it happen you
should awake with the Satisfaction of this Dream, you
should find your Heart still panting with the soft Pleasure
of the dear deceiving Transport, and you should be ready
to cry out,</p>

waking Thoughts should render me to your Heart.</p>


<h3>THREE o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                <i>Capricious Suffering in Dreams.</i>
</p>

<p>It is but just to mix a little Chagrin with these Pleasures,
a little Bitter with your Sweet; you may be cloy'd with
too long an Imagination of my Favours: and I will have
your Fancy in Dreams represent me to it, as the most
capricious Maid in the World. I know, here you will
accuse my <i>Watch</i>, and blame me with unnecessary Cruelty,
as you will call it: but Lovers have their little Ends, their
little Advantages, to pursue by Methods wholly unaccountable
to all, but that Heart which contrives 'em: And, as
good a Lover as I believe you, you will not enter into my
Design at first sight; and tho', on reasonable Thoughts,
you will be satisfied with this Conduct of mine, at its first
Approach you will be ready to cry out&mdash;</p>

<span class="i2"><i>In vain I search it ev'ry where:</i><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>No more than the dull Basset-board.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The Beauties in the Drawing-room,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Then since my Days so anxious prove,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Ah, cruel Tyrant! give</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A little Loose to Joys in Love,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And let your</i> Damon <i>live.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>All that a Man of Honour dares receive.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And may my Eyes eternal Watches keep,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rather than want that Pleasure when I sleep.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some such Complaint as this I know you will make;
but, <i>Damon</i>, if the little Quarrels of Lovers render the
reconciling Moments so infinitely charming, you must
needs allow, that these little Chagrin in capricious Dreams
must awaken you to more Joy to find 'em but Dreams,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
than if you had met with no Disorder there. 'Tis for this
reason that I would have you suffer a little Pain for a
coming Pleasure; nor, indeed is it possible for you to escape
the Dreams my <i>Cupid</i> points you out. You shall dream
that I have a thousand <i>Foibles</i>, something of the lightness
of my Sex; that my Soul is employ'd in a thousand
Vanities; that (proud and fond of Lovers) I make advances
for the Glory of a Slave, without any other Interest or
Design than that of being ador'd. I will give you leave
to think my Heart fickle, and that, far from resigning it
to any one, I lend it only for a Day, or an Hour, and take
it back at pleasure; that I am a very <i>Coquet</i>, even to
Impertinence.</p>

<p>All this I give you leave to think, and to offend me: but
'tis in sleep only that I permit it; for I would never pardon
you the least Offence of this nature, if in any other Kind
than in a Dream. Nor is it enough Affliction to you, to
imagine me thus idly vain; but you are to pass on to
a hundred more capricious Humours: as that I exact of
you a hundred unjust Things; that I pretend you should
break off with all your Friends, and for the future have none
at all; that I will myself do those Things, which I violently
condemn in you; and that I will have for others, as well
as you, that tender Friendship that resembles Love, or
rather that Love which People call Friendship; and that
I will not, after all, have you dare complain on me.</p>

<p>In fine, be as ingenious as you please to torment your
self; and believe, that I am become unjust, ungrateful,
and insensible: But were I so indeed, O <i>Damon</i>! consider
your awaking Heart, and tell me, would your Love stand
the proof of all these Faults in me? But know, that I would
have you believe I have none of these Weaknesses, tho'
I am not wholly without Faults, but those will be excusable
to a Lover; and this Notion I have of a perfect one:</p>

<h3>FOUR o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                      <i>Jealousy in Dreams</i>.
</p>

<p>Do not think, <i>Damon</i>, to wake yet; for I design you
shall yet suffer a little more: Jealousy must now possess
you, that Tyrant over the Heart, that compels your very
Reason, and seduces all your Good-Nature. And in this
Dream you must believe That in sleeping, which you
could not do me the injustice to do when awake. And
here you must explain all my Actions to the utmost disadvantage:
Nay, I will wish, that the Force of this
Jealousy may be so extreme, that it may make you languish
in Grief, and be overcome with Anger.</p>

<p>You shall now imagine, that one of your Rivals is with
me, interrupting all you say, or hindering all you would
say; that I have no Attention to what you say aloud to
me, but that I incline mine Ear to hearken to all that
he whispers to me. You shall repine, that he pursues
me every where, and is eternally at your heels if you
approach me; that I caress him with Sweetness in my
Eyes, and that Vanity in my Heart, that possesses the
Humours of almost all the Fair; that is, to believe it
greatly for my Glory to have abundance of Rivals for my
Lovers. I know you love me too well not to be extreamely
uneasy in the Company of a Rival, and to have one perpetually
near me; for let him be belov'd or not by the
Mistress, it must be confess'd, a Rival is a very troublesome
Person. But, to afflict you to the utmost, I will have
you imagine that my Eyes approve of all his Thoughts; that
they flatter him with Hopes; and that I have taken away
my Heart from you, to make a Present of it to this more
lucky Man. You shall suffer, while possess'd with this
Dream, all that a cruel Jealousy can make a tender Soul
suffer.</p>

yourself, yet you believe in this Dream, that I complain
of the Injuries you do my Fame; and that I am extreamely

this belief you accuse me of Weakness; you resolve to
see me no more, and are making a thousand feeble Vows
against Love. You esteem me as a false one, and resolve
to cease loving the vain <i>Coquet</i>, and will say to me, as

this Tye between you and I, <i>Damon</i>, is likely to last as

</p>

<p>Tho' the angry Lovers force themselves, all they can, to
chase away the troublesom Tenderness of the Heart, in
the height of their Quarrels, Love sees all their Sufferings,
pities and redresses 'em: And when we begin to cool,
and a soft Repentance follows the Chagrin of the Love-Quarrel,
'tis then that Love takes the advantage of both
Hearts, and renews the charming Friendship more forcibly
than ever, puts a stop to all our Feuds, and renders the
peace-making Minutes the most dear and tender part of
our Life. How pleasing 'tis to see your Rage dissolve!
How sweet, how soft is every Word that pleads for pardon
at my Feet! 'Tis there that you tell me, your very
Sufferings are over paid, when I but assure you from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Eyes, that I will forget your Crime: And your Imagination
shall here present me the most sensible of your past
Pain, that you can wish; and that all my Anger being
vanisht, I give you a thousand Marks of my Faith and
Gratitude; and lastly, to crown all, that we again make
new Vows to one another of inviolable Peace:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>After these Debates of Love,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lovers thousand Pleasures prove,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Which they ever think to taste,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tho' oftentimes they do not last.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Enjoy then all the Pleasures that a Heart that is very
amorous, and very tender, can enjoy. Think no more on
those Inquietudes that you have suffer'd; bless <i>Love</i> for
his Favours, and thank me for my Graces: and resolve
to endure any thing, rather than enter upon any new
Quarrels. And however dear the reconciling Moments
are, there proceeds a great deal of Evil from these little
frequent Quarrels; and I think the best Counsel we can
follow, is to avoid 'em as near as we can: And if we
cannot, but that, in spite of Love and good Understanding,
they should break out, we ought to make as speedy a Peace
as possible; for 'tis not good to grate the Heart too
long, lest it grow harden'd insensibly, and lose its native
Temper. A few Quarrels there must be in Love: Love
cannot support it self without 'em: and, besides the Joy
of an Accommodation, Love becomes by it more strongly
united, and more charming. Therefore let the Lover
receive this as a certain Receipt against declining Love:</p>

<h3>SEVEN o'CLOCK.</h3>

<p class="center">                         <i>Divers Dreams.</i>
</p>

<p>Behold, <i>Damon</i>, the last Hour of your Sleep, and of my
<i>Watch</i>. She leaves you at Liberty now, and you may
chuse your Dreams: Trust 'em to your Imaginations,
give a Loose to Fancy, and let it rove at will, provided,
<i>Damon</i>, it be always guided by a respectful <i>Love</i>. For
thus far I pretend to give bounds to your Imagination,
and will not have it pass beyond 'em: Take heed, in
sleeping, you give no ear to a flatt'ring <i>Cupid</i>, that will
favour your slumb'ring Minutes with Lyes too pleasing
and vain: You are discreet enough when you are awake;
will you not be so in Dreams?</p>

<p><i>Damon</i>, awake; my <i>Watch's</i> Course is done: after this,
you cannot be ignorant of what you ought to do during
my Absence. I did not believe it necessary to caution you
about Balls and Comedies; you know, a Lover depriv'd
of his Mistress, goes seldom there. But if you cannot
handsomely avoid these Diversions, I am not so unjust
a Mistress, to be angry with you for it; go, if Civility,
or other Duties oblige you: I will only forbid you, in
consideration of me, not to be too much satisfy'd with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
those Pleasures; but see 'em so, as the World may have
reason to say, you do not seek them, you do not make
a Business or Pleasure of them; and that 'tis Complaisance,
and not Inclination, that carries you thither. Seem rather
negligent than concern'd at any thing there; and let
every part of you say, Iris <i>is not here</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>I say nothing to you neither of your Duty elsewhere;
I am satisfy'd you know it too well; and have too great
a Veneration for your glorious Master, to neglect any
part of that for even Love it self. And I very well know
how much you love to be eternally near his illustrious
Person; and that you scarce prefer your Mistress before
him, in point of Love: In all things else, I give him
leave to take place of <i>Iris</i> in the noble Heart of <i>Damon</i>.</p>

<p>I am satisfy'd you pass your time well now at <i>Windsor</i>,
for you adore that Place; and 'tis not, indeed, without
great reason: for 'tis most certainly now render'd the
most glorious Palace in the Christian World. And had
our late Gracious Sovereign, of blessed Memory, had no
other Miracles and Wonders of his Life and Reign to
have immortaliz'd his Fame (of which there shall remain
a thousand to Posterity) this noble Structure alone, this
Building (almost Divine) would have eterniz'd the great
Name of Glorious <i>Charles</i> II. till the World moulder
again to its old Confusion, its first <i>Chaos</i>. And the
Paintings of the famous <i>Varrio</i>, and noble Carvings of
the unimitable <i>Gibbon</i>, shall never die, but remain to tell
succeeding Ages, that all Arts and Learning were not
confin'd to antient <i>Rome</i> and <i>Greece</i>, but that <i>England</i>
too could boast its mightiest Share. Nor is the Inside of
this magnificent Structure, immortaliz'd with so many
eternal Images of the illustrious <i>Charles</i> and <i>Katharine</i>,
more to be admired than the wondrous Prospects without.
The stupendous Heighth, on which the famous Pile is
built, renders the Fields, and flowery Meads below, the
Woods, the Thickets, and the winding Streams, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
delightful Object that ever Nature produc'd. Beyond all
these, and far below, in an inviting Vale, the venerable
College, an old, but noble Building, raises it self, in the midst
of all the Beauties of Nature, high-grown Trees, fruitful
Plains, purling Rivulets, and spacious Gardens, adorn'd
with all Variety of Sweets that can delight the Senses.</p>

<p>At farther distance yet, on an Ascent almost as high
as that to the Royal Structure, you may behold the famous
and noble <i>Clifdon</i> rise, a Palace erected by the illustrious
Duke of <i>Buckingham</i>, who will leave this wondrous Piece
of Architecture, to inform the future World of the Greatness
and Delicacy of his Mind; it being for its Situation,
its Prospects, and its marvellous Contrivances, one of the
finest <i>Villa's</i> of the World; at least, were it finish'd as
begun; and would sufficiently declare the magnifick Soul
of the Hero that caus'd it to be built, and contriv'd all
its Fineness. And this makes up not the least part of the
beautiful Prospect from the Palace Royal, while on the
other side lies spread a fruitful and delightful Park and
Forest well stor'd with Deer, and all that makes the
Prospect charming; fine Walks, Groves, distant Valleys,
Downs and Hills, and all that Nature could invent, to
furnish out a quiet soft Retreat for the most fair and most
charming of Queens, and the most Heroick, Good, and
Just of Kings: And these Groves alone are fit and worthy
to divert such earthly Gods.</p>

<p>Nor can Heaven, Nature, or human Art contrive an
Addition to this earthly Paradise, unless those great
Inventors of the Age, Sir <i>Samuel Morland</i>, or Sir <i>Robert
Gorden</i>, cou'd by the power of Engines, convey the Water
so into the Park and Castle, as to furnish it with delightful
Fountains, both useful and beautiful. These are only
wanting, to render the Place all Perfection, and without
Exception.</p>

<p>This, <i>Damon</i>, is a long Digression from the Business
of my Heart; but, you know I am so in love with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
charming Court, that when you gave me an occasion, by
your being there now, but to name the Place, I could
not forbear transgressing a little, in favour of its wondrous
Beauty; and the rather, because I would, in recounting
it, give you to understand how many fine Objects there
are, besides the Ladies that adorn it, to employ your vacant
Moments in; and I hope you will, without my Instructions,
pass a great part of your idle time in surveying these
Prospects, and give that Admiration you should pay to
living Beauty, to those more venerable Monuments of
everlasting Fame.</p>

<p>Neither need I, <i>Damon</i>, assign you your waiting Times:
your Honour, Duty, Love, and Obedience, will instruct
you when to be near the Person of the King; and, I believe,
you will omit no part of that Devoir. You ought to establish
your Fortune and your Glory: for I am not of the mind
of those critical Lovers, who believe it a very hard matter
to reconcile Love and Interest, to adore a Mistress, and
serve a Master at the same Time. And I have heard
those, who on this Subject, say, <i>Let a Man be never so
careful in these double Duties, 'tis ten to one but he loses his
Fortune or his Mistress</i>. These are Errors that I condemn:
And I know that Love and Ambition are not incompatible,
but that a brave Man may preserve all his Duties to his
Sovereign, and his Passion and his Respect for his Mistress.
And this is my Notion of it.</p>

<p>Such a Passion, <i>Damon</i>, can never make you quit any

a charming Force and Goodness, from all Mankind.</p>

<p>But I will stop the low Flight of my humble Muse,
who when she is upon the wing, on this glorious Subject,
knows no Bounds. And all the World has agreed to say

that they have left me nothing new to say; tho' indeed

I lost to you. If it be not valuable enough, I am generous
enough to make it good: And since I am so willing to be
just, you ought to esteem me, and to make it your chiefest
Care to preserve me yours; for I believe I shall deserve
it, and wish you should believe so too. Remember me,
write to me, and observe punctually all the Motions of
my <i>Watch</i>: The more you regard it, the better you will
like it; and whatever you think of it at first sight, 'tis no ill
Present. The Invention is soft and gallant; and <i>Germany</i>,

<h3>The CASE for the WATCH.</h3>


<h4>DAMON <i>to</i> IRIS.</h4>

<p>Expect not, Oh charming <i>Iris</i>! that I should chuse Words
to thank you in; (Words, that least Part of Love, and
least the Business of the Lover) but will say all, and
every thing that a tender Heart can dictate, to make an
Acknowledgment for so dear and precious a Present as this
of your charming <i>Watch</i>: while all I can say will but too
dully express my Sense of Gratitude, my Joy, and the
Pleasure I receive in the mighty Favour. I confess the
Present too rich, too gay, and too magnificent for my
Expectation: and tho' my Love and Faith deserve it, yet
my humbler Hope never durst carry me to a Wish of so
great a Bliss, so great an Acknowledgment from the Maid
I adore. The Materials are glorious, the Work delicate,
and the Movement just, and even gives Rules to my
Heart, who shall observe very exactly all that the <i>Cupid</i>
remarks to me; even to the Minutes, which I will point with
Sighs, tho' I am obliged to 'em there but every half Hour.</p>

<p>You tell me, fair <i>Iris</i>, that I ought to preserve it tenderly,
and yet you have sent it me without a Case. But that
I may obey you justly, and keep it dear to me, as long as I
live, I will give it a Case of my Fashion: It shall be delicate,
and suitable to the fine Present; of such Materials too.
But because I would have it perfect, I will consult your
admirable Wit and Invention in an Affair of so curious
a Consequence.</p>


<h4><i>The</i> FIGURE <i>of the</i> CASE.</h4>

<p>I design to give it the Figure of the Heart. Does not
your <i>Watch</i>, <i>Iris</i>, rule the Heart? It was your Heart that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
contrived it, and 'twas your Heart you consulted in all the
Management of it; and 'twas your Heart that brought it
to so fine a Conclusion. The Heart never acts without
Reason, and all the Heart projects, it performs with Pleasure.</p>

<p>Your <i>Watch</i>, my lovely Maid, has explain'd to me a
World of rich Secrets of Love: And where should Thoughts
so sacred be stored, but in the Heart, where all the Secrets
of the Soul are treasur'd up, and of which only <i>Love</i> alone
can take a view? 'Tis thence he takes his Sighs and Tears,
and all his little Flatteries and Arts to please; all his fine
Thoughts, and all his mighty Raptures; nothing is so proper
as the Heart to preserve it, nothing so worthy as the Heart
to contain it: and it concerns my Interest too much, not
to be infinitely careful of so dear a Treasure: And believe
me, charming <i>Iris</i>, I will never part with it.</p>

</div></div>

<p>After having told you, my lovely <i>Iris</i>, that I design
to put your <i>Watch</i> into a Heart, I ought to shew you
the Ornaments of the Case. I do intend to have 'em
crown'd Cyphers: I do not mean those Crowns of Vanity,
which are put indifferently on all sorts of Cyphers; no,
I must have such as may distinguish mine from the rest,
and may be true Emblems of what I would represent.
My four Cyphers therefore shall be crown'd with these
four Wreaths, of Olive, Laurel, Myrtle, and Roses: and the
Letters that begin the Names of <i>Iris</i> and <i>Damon</i> shall compose
the Cyphers; tho' I must intermix some other Letters
that bear another Sense, and have another Signification.</p>


<h4><i>The First</i> CYPHER.</h4>

<p>The first Cypher is compos'd of an <i>I</i> and a <i>D</i>, which are
join'd by an <i>L</i> and an <i>E</i>; which signifies <i>Love Extreme</i>.
And 'tis but just, Oh adorable <i>Iris</i>! that Love should be
mixt with our Cyphers, and that Love alone should be the
Union of 'em.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Love ought alone the Mystick Knot to tie;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Love, that great Master of all Arts:</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And this dear</i> Cypher <i>is to let you see,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Love unites Names as well as Hearts.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Without this charming Union, our Souls could not
communicate those invisible Sweetnesses, which compleat
the Felicity of Lovers, and which the most tender and
passionate Expressions are too feeble to make us comprehend.
But, my adorable <i>Iris</i>, I am contented with the
vast Pleasure I feel in loving well, without the care of
expressing it well; if you will imagine my Pleasure, without
expressing it: For I confess, 'twould be no Joy to
me to adore you, if you did not perfectly believe I did
adore you. Nay, tho' you lov'd me, if you had no Faith
in me, I should languish, and love in as much Pain, as if
you scorn'd; and at the same time believ'd I dy'd for you:
For surely, <i>Iris</i>, 'tis a greater Pleasure to please than to be
pleas'd; and the glorious Power of Giving is infinitely
a greater Satisfaction, than that of Receiving: there is so
Great and God-like a Quality in it. I would have your
Belief therefore equal to my Passion, extreme; as indeed
all Love should be, or it cannot bear that Divine Name:
it can pass but for an indifferent Affection. And these
Cyphers ought to make the World find all the noble Force
of delicate Passion: for, Oh my <i>Iris</i>! what would Love
signify, if we did not love fervently? Sisters and Brothers
love; Friends and Relations have Affections: but where the
Souls are join'd, which are fill'd with eternal soft Wishes,
Oh! there is some Excess of Pleasure, which cannot be
express'd!</p>

<p>Your Looks, your dear obliging Words, and your
charming Letters, have sufficiently persuaded me of your
Tenderness; and you might surely see the Excess of my
Passion by my Cares, my Sighs, and entire Resignation
to your Will. I never think of <i>Iris</i>, but my Heart feels
double Flames, and pants and heaves with double Sighs;
and whose Force makes its Ardours known, by a thousand
Transports: And they are very much to blame, to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the Name of Love to feeble easy Passions. Such transitory
tranquil Inclinations are at best but Well-wishers to Love;
and a Heart that has such Heats as those, ought not to put
it self into the Rank of those nobler Victims that are offer'd
at the Shrine of Love. But our Souls, <i>Iris</i>, burn with a more
glorious Flame, that lights and conducts us beyond a Possibility
of losing one another. 'Tis this that flatters all my
Hopes; 'tis this alone makes me believe my self worthy
of <i>Iris</i>: And let her judge of its Violence, by the Greatness
of its Splendour.</p>

<p>Does not a Passion of this nature, so true, so ardent,
deserve to be crown'd? And will you wonder to see, over
this Cypher, a Wreath of Myrtles, those Boughs so sacred
to the Queen of Love, and so worshipp'd by Lovers?
'Tis with these soft Wreaths, that those are crown'd, who
understand how to love well and faithfully.</p>

<h4><i>The Second</i> CYPHER,</h4>

<p>Is crown'd with Olives; and I add to the two Letters of
our Names an <i>R</i> and an <i>L</i>, for <i>Reciprocal Love</i>. Every time
that I have given you, O lovely <i>Iris</i>, Testimonies of my
Passion, I have been so blest, as to receive some from your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Bounty; and you have been pleased to flatter me with
a Belief, that I was not indifferent to you. I dare therefore
say, that being honour'd with the Glory of your
Tenderness and Care, I ought, as a Trophy of my illustrious
Conquest, to adorn the <i>Watch</i> with a Cypher that is so
advantageous to me. Ought I not to esteem my self the
most fortunate and happy of Mankind, to have exchanged
my Heart with so charming and admirable a Person as
<i>Iris</i>? Ah! how sweet, how precious is the Change; and
how vast a Glory arrives to me from it! Oh! you must
not wonder if my Soul abandon it self to a thousand
Extasies! In the Merchandize of Hearts, Oh, how dear it
is to receive as much as one gives; and barter Heart for
Heart! Oh! I would not receive mine again, for all
the Crowns the Universe contains! Nor ought you, my
Adorable, make any Vows or Wishes, ever to retrieve
yours; or shew the least Repentance for the Blessing you
have given me. The Exchange we made, was confirm'd
by a noble Faith; and you ought to believe, you have
bestow'd it well, since you are paid for it a Heart that is
so conformable to yours, so true, so just, and so full of
Adoration: And nothing can be the just Recompence of
Love, but Love: and to enjoy the true Felicity of it, our
Hearts ought to keep an equal Motion; and, like the
Scales of Justice, always hang even.</p>

<p>'Tis the Property of Reciprocal Love, to make the
Heart feel the Delicacy of Love, and to give the Lover
all the Ease and Softness he can reasonably hope. Such
a Love renders all things advantageous and prosperous:
Such a Love triumphs over all other Pleasures. And I put
a Crown of Olives over the Cypher of <i>Reciprocal Love</i>,
to make known, that two Hearts, where Love is justly
equal, enjoy a Peace that nothing can disturb.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h4><i>The Third</i> CYPHER.</h4>

<p>The <i>C</i> and the <i>L</i>, which are join'd to the Letters of our
Names in this Cypher crown'd with Laurel, explains a
<i>Constant Love</i>. It will not, my fair <i>Iris</i>, suffice, that my
Love is extreme, my Passion violent, and my Wishes
fervent, or that our Loves are reciprocal; but it ought
also to be constant: for in Love, the Imagination is oftner
carried to those things that may arrive, and which we wish
for, than to things that Time has robbed us of. And in
those agreeable Thoughts of Joys to come, the Heart takes
more delight to wander, than in all those that are past; tho'
the Remembrance of 'em be very dear, and very charming.
We should be both unjust, if we were not persuaded we
are possest with a Virtue, the Use of which is so admirable
as that of Constancy. Our Loves are not of that sort that
can finish, or have an end; but such a Passion, so perfect,
and so constant, that it will be a Precedent for future
Ages, to love perfectly; and when they would express an
extreme Passion, they will say, <i>They lov'd, as</i> Damon <i>did
the charming</i> Iris. And he that knows the Glory of constant
Love, will despise those fading Passions, those little
Amusements, that serve for a Day. What Pleasure or
Dependance can one have in a Love of that sort? What
Concern? What Raptures can such an Amour produce
in a Soul? And what Satisfaction can one promise one's
self in playing with a false Gamester; who tho' you are
aware of him, in spite of all your Precaution, puts the
false Dice upon you, and wins all?</p>

</div></div>

<p>Constant Love finds it self impossible to be shaken; it
resists the Attacks of Envy, and a thousand Accidents
that endeavour to change it: Nothing can disoblige it but
a known Falseness, or Contempt: Nothing can remove
it; tho' for a short moment it may lie sullen and resenting,
it recovers, and returns with greater Force and Joy.
I therefore, with very good reason, crown this <i>Cypher</i> of
<i>Constant Love</i> with a Wreath of <i>Laurel</i>; since such Love
always triumphs over Time and Fortune, tho' it be not
her Property to besiege: for she cannot overcome, but in
defending her self; but the Victories she gains are never
the less glorious.</p>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>The Fourth</i> CYPHER.</h4>

<p>Perhaps, my lovely Maid, you will not find out what I
mean by the <i>S</i> and the <i>L</i>, in this last Cypher, that is crown'd
with Roses. I will therefore tell you, I mean <i>Secret Love</i>.
There are very few People who know the Nature of that
Pleasure, which so divine a Love creates: And let me say
what I will of it, they must feel it themselves, who would
rightly understand it, and all its ravishing Sweets. But
this there is a great deal of Reason to believe, that the
Secrecy in Love doubles the Pleasures of it. And I am so
absolutely persuaded of this, that I believe all those Favours
that are not kept secret, are dull and pall'd, very insipid and
tasteless Pleasures: And let the Favours be never so innocent
that a Lover receives from a Mistress, she ought to
value 'em, set a price upon 'em, and make the Lover pay
dear; while he receives 'em with Difficulty, and sometimes
with Hazard. A Lover that is not secret, but suffers
every one to count his Sighs, has at most but a feeble
Passion, such as produces sudden and transitory Desires,
which die as soon as born: A true Love has not this
Character; for whensoever 'tis made publick, it ceases to
be a Pleasure, and is only the Result of Vanity. Not
that I expect our Loves should always remain a Secret:
No, I should never, at that rate, arrive to a Blessing,
which, above all the Glories of the Earth, I aspire to;
but even then there are a thousand Joys, a thousand
Pleasures that I shall be as careful to conceal from the
foolish World, as if the whole Preservation of that Pleasure
depended on my Silence; as indeed it does in a great
measure.</p>

<p>To this Cypher I put a Crown of Roses, which are
not Flowers of a very lasting Date. And 'tis to let you
see, that 'tis impossible Love can be long hid. We see
every Day, with what fine Dissimulation and Pains,
People conceal a thousand Hates and Malices, Disgusts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Disobligations, and Resentments, without being able to
conceal the least part of their Love: but Reputation has
an Odour as well as Roses; and a Lover ought to esteem
that as the dearest and tenderest thing: not only that of
his own, which is, indeed, the least part; but that of
his Mistress, more valuable to him than Life. He ought
to endeavour to give People no occasion to make false
Judgments of his Actions, or to give their Censures;
which most certainly are never in the Favour of the Fair
Person: for likely, those false Censurers are of the busy
Female Sex, the <i>Coquets</i> of that number; whose little
Spites and Railleries, join'd to that fancy'd Wit they
boast of, sets 'em at odds with all the Beautiful and Innocent.
And how very little of that kind serves to give the
World a Faith, when a thousand Virtues, told of the
same Persons, by more credible Witnesses and Judges,
shall pass unregarded! so willing and inclin'd is all the
World to credit the Ill, and condemn the Good! And
yet, Oh! what pity 'tis we are compell'd to live in Pain,
to oblige this foolish scandalous World! And tho' we
know each other's Virtue and Honour, we are oblig'd to
observe that Caution (to humour the talking Town) which
takes away so great a part of the Pleasure of Life! 'Tis
therefore that among those Roses, you will find some
Thorns; by which you may imagine, that in Love,
Precaution is necessary to its Secrecy: And we must
restrain our selves, upon a thousand occasions, with so
much Care, that, Oh <i>Iris</i>! 'tis impossible to be discreet,
without Pain; but 'tis a Pain that creates a thousand
Pleasures.</p>

<h4><i>The</i> CLASP <i>of the</i> WATCH.</h4>

<p>Ah, charming <i>Iris</i>! Ah, my lovely Maid! 'tis now, in a
more peculiar manner, that I require your Aid in the
finishing of my Design, and compleating the whole Piece
to the utmost Perfection; and without your Aid it cannot
be perform'd. It is about the Clasp of the <i>Watch</i>; a
Material, in all appearance, the most trivial of any part
of it. But that it may be safe for ever, I design it the
Image, or Figure of two Hands; that fair one of the
adorable <i>Iris</i>, join'd to mine; with this Motto, <i>Inviolable
Faith</i>: For in this <i>Case</i>, this Heart ought to be shut up
by this eternal Clasp. Oh! there is nothing so necessary
as this! Nothing can secure Love, but Faith.</p>

<p>That Virtue ought to be a Guard to all the Heart
thinks, and all the Mouth utters: Nor can <i>Love</i> say he
triumphs without it. And when that remains not in the
Heart, all the rest deserves no Regard. Oh! I have not
lov'd so ill to leave one Doubt upon your Soul. Why
then, will you want that Faith, Oh unkind Charmer,
that my Passion and my Services so justly merit?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>When two Hearts entirely love,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And in one Sphere of Honour move,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Each maintains the other's Fire,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With a Faith that is entire.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Faith without Love, bears Virtue's Price;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But Love without her Mixture, is a Vice.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Love, like Religion, still should be,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>In the Foundation, firm and true;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>In Points of Faith should still agree,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Tho' Innovations vain and new,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Love's little Quarrels, may arise;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In Fundamentals still they're just and wise.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Then, charming Maid, be sure of this;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Allow me Faith, as well as Love:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Since that alone affords no Bliss,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Unless your Faith your Love improve.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Either resolve to let me die</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>By fairer Play, your Cruelty;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Than not your Love with Faith impart,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And with your Vows to give your Heart.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In mad Despair I'd rather fall,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Than lose my glorious Hopes of conquering all.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So certain it is, that Love without Faith, is of no value.</p>

<p>In fine, my adorable <i>Iris</i>, this Case shall be, as near as
I can, like those delicate ones of <i>Filligrin</i> Work, which do
not hinder the Sight from taking a View of all within:
You may therefore see, thro' this Heart, all your <i>Watch</i>.
Nor is my Desire of preserving this inestimable Piece more,
than to make it the whole Rule of my Life and Actions.
And my chiefest Design in these Cyphers, is to comprehend
in them the principal Virtues that are most necessary
to Love. Do not we know that Reciprocal Love is Justice?
Constant Love, Fortitude? Secret Love, Prudence? Tho'
'tis true that extreme Love, that is, Excess of Love, in one
sense, appears not to be Temperance; yet you must know,
my <i>Iris</i>, that in Matters of Love, Excess is a Virtue, and
that all other Degrees of Love are worthy Scorn alone.
'Tis this alone that can make good the glorious Title:
'Tis this alone that can bear the Name of Love; and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
alone that renders the Lovers truly happy, in spight of all
the Storms of Fate, and Shocks of Fortune. This is an
Antidote against all other Griefs: This bears up the Soul
in all Calamity; and is the very Heaven of Life, the last
Refuge of all worldly Pain and Care, and may well bear
the Title of <i>Divine</i>.</p>

you will not allow your Charms to be infinite. You must
either accuse my Flames to be unreasonable, and that my
Eyes and Heart are false Judges of Wit and Beauty; or
allow that you are the most perfect of your Sex. But
instead of that, you always accuse me of Flattery, when
I speak of your infinite Merit; and when I refer you to
your Glass, you tell me, that flatters as well as <i>Damon</i>:
tho' one would imagine, that should be a good Witness for
the Truth of what I say, and undeceive you of the Opinion
of my Injustice. Look&mdash;and confirm your self that nothing
can equal your Perfections. All the World says it, and
you must doubt it no longer. Oh <i>Iris</i>! will you dispute
against the whole World?</p>

<p>But since you have so long distrusted your own Glass,
I have here presented you with one, which I know is very
true; and having been made for you only, can serve only
you. All other Glasses present all Objects, but this reflects
only <i>Iris</i>: Whenever you consult it, it will convince you;
and tell you how much Right I have done you, when
I told you, you were the fairest Person that ever Nature
made. When other Beauties look into it, it will speak to
all the Fair Ones: but let 'em do what they will, 'twill
say nothing to their advantage.</p>

<h4>IRIS's <i>LOOKING-GLASS</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Damon</i> (Oh charming <i>Iris</i>!) has given me to you, that
you may sometimes give your self the Trouble, and me the
Honour of consulting me in the great and weighty Affairs
of Beauty. I am, my adorable Mistress! a faithful Glass;
and you ought to believe all I say to you.</p>


<h4><i>The SHAPE of</i> IRIS.</h4>

<p>I must begin with your Shape, and tell you without
Flattery, 'tis the finest in the World, and gives Love and
Admiration to all that see you. Pray observe how free
and easy it is, without Constraint, Stiffness, or Affectation;
those mistaken Graces of the Fantastick, and the
Formal, who give themselves pain to shew their Will to
please, and whose Dressing makes the greatest part of
its Fineness, when they are more oblig'd to the Taylor
than to Nature; who add or diminish, as occasion serves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to form a Grace, where Heaven never gave it: And
while they remain on this Wreck of Pride, they are
eternally uneasy, without pleasing any body. <i>Iris</i>, I have
seen a Woman of your Acquaintance, who, having a
greater Opinion of her own Person than any body else,
has screw'd her Body into so fine a Form (as she calls it)
that she dares no more stir a Hand, lift up an Arm, or
turn her Head aside, than if, for the Sin of such a Disorder,
she were to be turn'd into a Pillar of Salt; the less
stiff and fix'd Statue of the two. Nay, she dares not
speak or smile, lest she should put her Face out of that
Order she had set it in her Glass, when she last look'd on
her self: And is all over such a <i>Lady Nice</i> (excepting in
her Conversation) that ever made a ridiculous Figure.
And there are many Ladies more, but too much tainted
with that nauseous Formality, that old-fashion'd Vice:
But <i>Iris</i>, the charming, the all-perfect <i>Iris</i>, has nothing
in her whole Form that is not free, natural, and easy;
and whose every Motion cannot but please extremely;
and which has not given <i>Damon</i> a thousand Rivals.</p>

<h4>IRIS<i>'s COMPLEXION</i>.</h4>

<p>Say what you will, I am confident, if you will confess
your Heart, you are, every time you view your self in
me, surpris'd at the Beauty of your Complexion; and
will secretly own, you never saw any thing so fair. I am
not the first Glass, by a thousand, that has assur'd you of
this. If you will not believe me, ask <i>Damon</i>; he tells it
you every Day, but that Truth from him offends you:
and because he loves too much, you think his Judgment
too little; and since this is so perfect, that must be defective.
But 'tis most certain your Complexion is infinitely
fine, your Skin soft and smooth as polisht Wax, or Ivory,
extreamely white and clear; tho' if any body speaks but
of your Beauty, an agreeable Blush casts it self all over
your Face, and gives you a thousand new Graces.</p>

<h4>IRIS<i>'s HAIR</i>.</h4>

<p>Oh, the beautiful Hair of <i>Iris</i>! it seems as if Nature had
crown'd you with a great quantity of lovely fair brown
Hair, to make us know that you were born to rule, and
to repair the Faults of Fortune that has not given you
a Diadem: And do not bewail the Want of that (so much
your Merit's due) since Heaven has so gloriously recompensed
you with what gains more admiring Slaves.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Heav'n for Sovereignty has made your Form:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And you were more than for dull Empire born;</i><br /></span>

<p><i>Love</i> does not make less use of your Hair for new Conquests,
than of all the rest of your Beauties that adorn you.
If he takes our Hearts with your fine Eyes, it ties 'em
fast with your Hair; and of it weaves a Chain, not easily
broken. It is not of those sorts of Hair, whose Harshness
discovers Ill-Nature; nor of those, whose Softness shews
us the Weakness of the Mind; not that either of these
Arguments are without exception: but 'tis such as bears
the Character of a perfect Mind, and a delicate Wit; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
for its Colour, the most faithful, discreet, and beautiful in
the World: such as shews a Complexion and Constitution,
neither so cold to be insensible, nor so hot to have too
much Fire: that is, neither too white, nor too black; but
such a mixture of the two Colours, as makes it the most
agreeable in the World.</p>

<p>I believe, my fair Mistress, I shall dazzle you with the
Lustre of your own Eyes. They are the finest Blue in
World: They have all the Sweetness that ever charm'd
the Heart, with a certain Languishment that's irresistible;
and never any look'd on 'em, that did not sigh after 'em.
Believe me, <i>Iris</i>, they carry unavoidable Darts and Fires;

their Imprudence.</p>

of your Eyes, which no Mortal can resist, nor any Heart
stand the Force of their Charms, and the most difficult
Conquest they gain, scarce cost 'em the expence of a Look.
They are modest and tender, chaste and languishing. There
you may take a view of the whole Soul, and see Wit and
Good-Nature (those two inseparable Virtues of the Mind)
in an extraordinary measure. In fine, you see all that fair
Eyes can produce, to make themselves ador'd. And when
they are angry, they strike an unresistible Awe upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>

<h4><i>The MOUTH of</i> IRIS.</h4>

<p>I perceive your Modesty would impose Silence on me:
But, Oh fair <i>Iris</i>! do not think to present your self
before a Glass, if you would not have it tell you all your
Beauties. Content your self that I only speak of 'em, <i>en
passant</i>; for should I speak what I would, I should dwell
all Day upon each Particular, and still say something new.
Give me liberty then to speak of your fine Mouth: You
need only open it a little, and you will see the most
delicate Teeth that ever you beheld; the whitest, and
the best set. Your Lips are the finest in the World; so
round, so soft, so plump, so dimpled, and of the loveliest
Colour. And when you smile, Oh! what Imagination
can conceive how sweet it is, that has not seen you
smiling? I cannot describe what I so admire; and 'tis in
vain to those who have not seen <i>Iris</i>.</p>

<h4><i>The NECK of</i> IRIS.</h4>

<p>All your Modesty, all your nice Care, cannot hide the
ravishing Beauties of your Neck; we must see it, coy as
you are; and see it the whitest, and finest shaped, that
ever was form'd. Oh! why will you cover it? You
know all handsome Things would be seen. And Oh!
how often have you made your Lovers envy your Scarf,
or any thing that hides so fine an Object from their Sight.
<i>Damon</i> himself complains of your too nice Severity. Pray
do not hide it so carefully. See how perfectly turn'd it
is! with small blue Veins, wand'ring and ranging here
and there, like little Rivulets, that wanton o'er the flowery
Meads! See how the round white rising Breasts heave
with every Breath, as if they disdain'd to be confin'd to
a Covering; and repel the malicious Cloud that would
obscure their Brightness!</p>

<h4><i>The ARMS and HANDS of</i> IRIS.</h4>

<p>I shall not be put to much trouble to shew you your
Hands and Arms, because you may view them without
my Help; and you are very unjust, if you have not
admir'd 'em a thousand times. The beautiful Colour and
Proportion of your Arm is unimitable, and your Hand is
dazzling, fine, small, and plump; long-pointed Fingers
delicately turned; dimpled on the snowy out-side, but
adorned within with Rose, all over the soft Palm. Oh
<i>Iris</i>! nothing equals your fair Hand; that Hand, of which
<i>Love</i> so often makes such use to draw his Bow, when he
would send the Arrow home with more Success; and
which irresistibly wounds those, who possibly have not
yet seen your Eyes: And when you have been veil'd,
that lovely Hand has gain'd you a thousand Adorers.
And I have heard <i>Damon</i> say, <i>Without the Aid of more
Beauties, that alone had been sufficient to have made an absolute
Conquest, o'er his Soul</i>. And he has often vow'd, <i>It never
toucht him but it made his Blood run with little irregular
Motions in his Veins, his Breath beat short and double, his
Blushes rise, and his very Soul dance</i>.</p>

<h4><i>The GRACE and AIR of</i> IRIS.</h4>

<p>'Tis I alone, O charming Maid! that can shew you that
noble part of your Beauty: That generous Air that adorns
all your lovely Person, and renders every Motion and Action
perfectly adorable. With what a Grace you walk!&mdash;How
free, how easy, and how unaffected! See how you move!&mdash;for
only here you can see it. <i>Damon</i> has told you a thousand
times, that never any Mortal had so glorious an Air: but
he cou'd not half describe it, nor would you credit even
what he said; but with a careless Smile pass it off for the
Flattery of a Lover. But here behold, and be convinc'd,
and know, no part of your Beauty can charm more than
this. O <i>Iris</i>! confess, Love has adorn'd you with all his
Art and Care. Your Beauties are the Themes of all the
Muses; who tell you in daily Songs, that the Graces themselves
have not more than <i>Iris</i>. And one may truly say, that
you alone know how to join the Ornaments and Dress
with Beauty; and you are still adorn'd, as if that Shape
and Air had a peculiar Art to make all Things appear gay
and fine. Oh! how well drest you are! How every Thing
becomes you! Never singular, never gawdy; but always
suiting with your Quality.</p>

<h4><i>The DISCRETION of</i> IRIS.</h4>

<p>But, O <i>Iris</i>! the Beauties of the Body are imperfect,
if the Beauties of the Soul do not advance themselves to
an equal Height. But, O <i>Iris</i>! what Mortal is there so
damn'd to Malice, that does not, with Adoration, confess,
that you, O charming Maid, have an equal Portion of all
the Braveries and Virtues of the Mind? And who is it,
that confesses your Beauty, that does not at the same time
acknowledge and bow to your Wisdom? The whole
World admires both in you; and all with impatience ask,
Which of the two is most surprizing, your Beauty, or your
Discretion? But we dispute in vain on that excellent
Subject; for after all, 'tis determin'd, that the two Charms
are equal. 'Tis none of those idle Discretions that consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
in Words alone, and ever takes the Shadow of Reason for
the Substance; and that makes use of all the little Artifices
of Subtlety, and florid Talking, to make the Out-side of
the Argument appear fine, and leave the Inside wholly
misunderstood; who runs away with Words, and never
thinks of Sense. But you, O lovely Maid! never make
use of these affected Arts; but without being too brisk
or too severe, too silent or too talkative, you inspire in all
your Hearers a Joy, and a Respect. Your Soul is an Enemy
to that usual Vice of your Sex, of using little Arguments
against the Fair; or, by a Word or Jest, making your
self and Hearers pleasant at the expence of the Fame of
others.</p>

<p>Your Heart is an Enemy to all Passions, but that of
Love. And this is one of your noble Maxims, <i>That every
one ought to love, in some part of his Life; and that in a Heart
truly brave, Love is without Folly: That Wisdom is a Friend
to Love, and Love to perfect Wisdom.</i> Since these Maxims
are your own, do not, O charming <i>Iris</i>! resist that noble
Passion: and since <i>Damon</i> is the most tender of Lovers,
answer his Passion with a noble Ardour. Your Prudence
never fails in the Choice of your Friends; and in chusing
so well your Lover, you will stand an eternal Precedent
to all unreasonable Fair Ones.</p>

<span class="i2"><i>O thou that dost excel in Wit and Youth!</i><br /></span>

<h4><i>The GOODNESS and COMPLAISANCE of</i> IRIS.</h4>

<p>Who but your Lovers, fair <i>Iris</i>! doubts but you are the
most complaisant Person in the World; and that with
so much Sweetness you oblige all, that you command in
yielding: And as you gain the Heart of both Sexes, with
the Affability of your noble Temper; so all are proud
and vain of obliging you. And, <i>Iris</i>, you may live assur'd,
that your Empire is eternally established by your Beauty
and your Goodness: Your Power is confirm'd, and you
grow in Strength every Minute: Your Goodness gets
you Friends, and your Beauty Lovers.</p>

<p>This Goodness is not one of those, whose Folly renders
it easy to every Desirer; but a pure Effect of the Generosity
of your Soul; such as Prudence alone manages, according
to the Merit of the Person to whom it is extended; and
those whom you esteem, receive the sweet Marks of it,
and only your Lovers complain; yet even then you charm.
And tho' sometimes you can be a little disturb'd, yet thro'
your Anger your Goodness shines; and you are but too
much afraid, that that may bear a false Interpretation:
For oftentimes Scandal makes that pass for an Effect of
Love, which is purely that of Complaisance.</p>

<p>Never had any body more Tenderness for their Friends,
than <i>Iris</i>: Their Presence gives her Joy, their Absence
Trouble; and when she cannot see them, she finds no
Pleasure like speaking of them obligingly. Friendship
reigns in your Heart, and Sincerity on your Tongue.
Your Friendship is so strong, so constant, and so tender,
that it charms, pleases, and satisfies all, that are not your
Adorers. <i>Damon</i> therefore is excusable, if he be not contented
with your noble Friendship alone; for he is the
most tender of that Number.</p>

<h4><i>The WIT of</i> IRIS.</h4>

<p>You are deceiv'd in me, fair <i>Iris</i>, if you take me for one
of those ordinary Glasses, that represent the Beauty only
of the Body; I remark to you also the Beauties of the
Soul: And all about you declares yours the finest that ever
was formed; that you have a Wit that surprizes, and is
always new: 'Tis none of those that loses its Lustre when
one considers it; the more we examine yours, the more
adorable we find it. You say nothing that is not at once
agreeable and solid; 'tis always quick and ready, without
Impertinence, that little Vanity of the Fair: who, when
they know they have Wit, rarely manage it so, as not to
abound in Talking; and think, that all they say must
please, because luckily they sometimes chance to do so.
But <i>Iris</i> never speaks, but 'tis of use; and gives a Pleasure
to all that hear her: She has the perfect Air of penetrating,
even the most secret Thoughts. How often have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
known, without being told, all that has past in <i>Damon's</i>
Heart? For all great Wits are Prophets too.</p>

<h4><i>The MODESTY of</i> IRIS.</h4>

<p>I perceive, fair <i>Iris</i>, you have a mind to tell me, I have
entertain'd you too long with a Discourse on your self.
I know your Modesty makes this Declaration an Offence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and you suffer me, with Pain, to unveil those Treasures
you would hide. Your Modesty, that so commendable
a Virtue in the Fair, and so peculiar to you, is here a little
too severe. Did I flatter you, you should blush: Did
I seek, by praising you, to shew an Art of speaking finely,
you might chide. But, O <i>Iris</i>, I say nothing but such plain
Truths, as all the World can witness are so: And so far
I am from Flattery, that I seek no Ornament of Words.
Why do you take such Care to conceal your Virtues?
They have too much Lustre, not to be seen, in spight of
all your Modesty: Your Wit, your Youth, and Reason,
oppose themselves against this dull Obstructer of our
Happiness. Abate, O <i>Iris</i>, a little of this Virtue, since you
have so many others to defend your self against the Attacks
of your Adorers. You your self have the least Opinion of
your own Charms: and being the only Person in the World,
that is not in love with 'em, you hate to pass whole Hours
before your <i>Looking-Glass</i>; and to pass your Time, like
most of the idle Fair, in dressing, and setting off those
Beauties, which need so little Art. You more wise, disdain
to give those Hours to the Fatigue of Dressing, which
you know so well how to employ a thousand ways. The
Muses have blest you, above your Sex; and you know how
to gain a Conquest with your Pen, more absolutely than
all the industrious Fair, who trust to Dress and Equipage.</p>

<p>I have a thousand Things to tell you more, but willingly
resign my Place to <i>Damon</i>, that faithful Lover; he
will speak more ardently than I: For let a Glass use all
its Force, yet, when it speaks its best, it speaks but coldly.</p>

<p>If my Glass, O charming <i>Iris</i>, have the good Fortune
(which I could never entirely boast) to be believ'd, 'twill
serve at least to convince you I have not been so guilty
of Flattery, as I have a thousand Times been charg'd.
Since then my Passion is equal to your Beauty (without
Comparison, or End) believe, O lovely Maid! how I sigh
in your Absence; and be persuaded to lessen my Pain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and restore me to my Joys: for there is no Torment so
great, as the Absence of a Lover from his Mistress; of
which this is the <i>Idea</i>.</p>

Earl of <i>Salisbury</i>, Viscount <i>Cramborn</i>, and Baron of <i>Islington</i>.
</h3>

<p>
My Lord,<br />
</p>

<p>Who should one celibrate with Verse and Song, but the Great, the Noble
and the Brave? where dedicate an <i>Isle of Love</i>, but to the Gay, the Soft
and Young? and who amongst Men can lay a better claim to these than
Your Lordship? who like the Sun new risen with the early Day, looks
round the World and sees nothing it cannot claim an interest in (for what
cannot Wit, Beauty, Wealth and Honour claim?) The violent storms of
Sedition and Rebellion are hush'd and calm'd; black Treason is retir'd
to its old abode, the dark Abyss of Hell; the mysterious Riddles of Politick
Knaves and Fools, which so long amused and troubled the World's repose,
are luckily unfolded; and Your Lordship is saluted at Your first coming
forth, Your first setting out for the glorious and happy Race of Life, by
a Nation all glad, gay and smiling; and you have nothing before you but a
ravishing prospect of eternal Joys, and everlasting inviting Pleasures, and
all that Love and Fortune can bestow on their darling Youth, attend You
in the noble pursuit; and nothing can prevent Your being the most happy
of her Favourites, but a too eager flight, a too swift speed o'er the charming
flowry Meads and Plains that lie in view, between Your setting out and the
end of Your glorious Chase. A long and illustrious race of Nobility has
attended Your great Name, but none I believe ever came into the World
with Your Lordship's advantages; amongst which, my Lord, 'tis not the
least that You have the glory to be truly Loyal, and to be adorn'd with those
excellent Principles, which render Nobility so absolutely worth the Veneration
which is paid 'em; 'tis those, my Lord, and not the Title that make
it truly great: Grandeur in any other serves but to point 'em out more
particularly to the World, and shew their Faults with the greater magnitude,
and render 'em more liable to contempt and that Reward which justly persues
Ingratitude; nor is it, my Lord, the many unhappy Examples this Age
has produc'd that has deterr'd you from herding with the busie Unfortunates,
and bringing Your powerful aid to their detestable cause, but a noble Honesty
in Your Nature, a Generosity in Your Soul. That even part of Your
Education had the good fortune not to be able to corrupt; no Opinion cou'd
bypass You, no Precedent debauch You; though all the fansied Glories of
Power were promis'd You, though all the Contempt thrown on good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
brave Men, all the subtile Arguments of the old Serpent, were us'd against
the best of Kings and his illustrious Successor, still You were unmov'd;
Your young stout Heart with a Gallantry and Force unusual resisted and
defied the gilded Bait, laugh'd at the industrious Politicks of the busie Wise,
and stubbornly Loyal, contemn'd the Counsels of the Grave. Go on, my
Lord, advance in Noble resolution, grow up in strength of Loyalty, settle
it about Your Soul, root it there like the first Principles of Religion, which
nothing ever throughly defaces, and which in spight of even Reason the
Soul retains, whatever little Debaucheries the Tongue may commit; You
that are great, are born the Bulwarks of sacred Majesty, its defence against
all the storms of Fate, the Safety of the People in the Supporters of the
Throne; and sure none that ever obey'd the Laws of God and the Dictates
of Honour ever paid those Duties to a Sovereign that more truly merited
the Defence and Adorations of his People than this of ours; and tis a blessing
(since we are oblig'd to render it to the worst of Tyrant Kings) that we
have one who so well justifies that intire Love and Submission we ought
to pay him. You, my Lord, are one whom Thousands of good Men look
up to with wondrous Veneration and Joy, when 'tis said Your Lordship
amongst Your other Vertues is Loyal too, a true Tory! (a word of Honour
now, the Royal Cause has sanctified it,) and though Your Lordship needs
no encouragement to a good that rewards it self, yet I am confident You
are not onely rank'd in the esteem of the best of Monarchs, but we shall
behold you as one of our Preservers, and all <i>England</i> as one of its great
Patrons, when Ages that shall come shall find Your noble Name inroll'd
amongst the Friends to Monarchy in an Age of so villainous Corruption:
Yes, my Lord, they will find it there and bless You. 'Tis this, my Lord,
with every other Grace and Noble Vertue that adorns You, and gives the
World such promises of Wonders in You, that makes me ambitious to be
the first in the Croud of Your Admirers, that shall have the honour to celibrate
Your great Name. Be pleased then, my Lord, to accept this Little
Piece, which lazy Minutes begot and hard Fate has oblig'd me to bring forth
into the censuring World, to which if any thing can reconcile it, 'twill be
the glory it has to bear Your Noble Name in the front, and to be Patronized
by so great and good a Man: Permit but my Zeal for Your Lordship to
attone for the rest of my Faults, and Your Lordship will extremely oblige,</p>

<span class="i0">Oh, wonder of thy Sex! Where can we see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty and Knowledge join'd except in thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such pains took Nature with your Heav'nly Face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Form'd it for Love, and moulded every Grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I doubted first and fear'd that you had been<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I see the folly of that fear, and find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Face is not more beauteous than your Mind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whoe'er beheld you with a Heart unmov'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sent not sighs, and said within he lov'd?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gaz'd and found, a then, unknown delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life in your looks, and Death to leave the sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What joys, new Worlds of joys has he possest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gain'd the sought-for welcome of your Breast?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your Wit wou'd recommend the homeliest Face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Beauty make the dullest Humour please;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But where they both thus gloriously are join'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All Men submit, you reign in every Mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Passions does your Poetry impart?</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shews th'unfathom'd thing a Woman's Heart,</span>

  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Displays the several Scenes of Hopes and Fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love's Smiles, his Sighs, his Laughing and his Tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each Lover here may reade his different Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Mistress kindness or her scornfull hate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come all whom the blind God has led astray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the bewildred Youth is shew'd his way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guided by this he may yet love and find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ease in his Heart, and reason in his Mind.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>

<span class="i0">All the World list'ned but his scornfull Fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pride stopt her ears to whom he bent his prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Much happier you that can't desire in vain,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">All Gay, all Charming to my sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My Drooping Soul it Rais'd and Cheer'd,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">That now I find an equal share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Love and Admiration in my Heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">And while I read, in vain I strove<br /></span>
<span class="i10">To hide the Pleasure which I took;<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Bellario</i> saw in ev'ry Look<br /></span>
<span class="i8">My smiling Joy and blushing Love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft ev'ry word, easie each Line, and true;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Brisk, witty, manly, strong and gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">The Thoughts are tender all, and new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fancy ev'ry where does gently play,<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Amyntas</i>, if you thus go on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like an unwearied Conqueror day and night,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">The World at last must be undone.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">You do not only kill at sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">But like a <i>Parthian</i> in your flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Whether you Rally or Retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">You still have Arrows for Defeat.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And all the Day my list'ning Soul I hung</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the charming Musick of thy Tongue,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never thought the blessed hours too long.</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Swain, no God like thee cou'd ever move,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or had so soft an Art in whisp'ring Love.</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No wonder for thou art Ally'd to <i>Jove</i>!</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when you pip'd, or sung, or danc'd, or spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The God appear'd in every Grace, and Look.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pride of the Swains, and Glory of the Shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Grief, and Joy of all the Love-sick Maids.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus whilst all hearts you rul'd without Controul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I reign'd the absolute Monarch of your Soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each Beach my Name yet bears, carv'd out by thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Paris</i>, and his <i>[OE]none</i> fill each Tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as they grow, the Letters larger spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grow still a witness of my Wrongs when dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Close by a silent silver Brook there grows</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Poplar, under whose dear gloomy Boughs</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand times we have exchang'd our Vows!</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh may'st thou grow! t' an endless date of Years!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who on thy Bark this fatal Record bears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>When</i> Paris <i>to</i> [OE]none <i>proves untrue,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Back</i> Xanthus <i>Streams shall to their Fountains flow.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn! turn your Tides! back to your Fountains run!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The perjur'd Swain from all his Faith is gone!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Curst be that day, may Fate appoint the hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Ominous in his black Kalendar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When <i>Venus</i>, <i>Pallas</i>, and the Wife of <i>Jove</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descended to thee in the Mirtle Grove,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In shining Chariots drawn by winged Clouds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked they came, no Veil their Beauty shrouds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But every Charm, and Grace expos'd to view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left Heav'n to be survey'd, and judg'd by you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bribe thy voice <i>Juno</i> wou'd Crowns bestow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pallas</i> more gratefully wou'd dress thy Brow<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of all the fairest <i>Greeks</i>! and had thy Voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowns, and more glorious Wreaths thou didst despise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And promis'd Beauty more than Empire prize!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This when you told, Gods! what a killing fear</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did over all my shivering Limbs appear?</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I presag'd some ominous Change was near!</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Blushes left my Cheeks, from every part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bloud ran swift to guard my fainting heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You in my Eyes the glimmering Light perceiv'd</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of parting Life, and on my pale Lips breath'd</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such Vows, as all my Terrors undeceiv'd.</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon the envying Gods disturb'd our Joy,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet this no Wonder, or Amazement brought,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Your Joys of Pow'r, or parting Discontents.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You kist the Tears which down my Cheeks did glide,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whilst sighs and looks, all dying spoke the rest.</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About thy Neck my feeble Arms I cast,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To stay, what dear Excuses didst thou frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fansiedst Tempests when the Seas were calm?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft the Winds contrary feign'd to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they, alas, were onely so to me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft new Vows of lasting Faith you swore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'twixt your Kisses all the old run o'er?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But now the wisely Grave, who Love despise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Themselves past hope) do busily advise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whisper Renown, and Glory in thy Ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Language which Lovers fright, and Swains ne'er hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For <i>Troy</i>, they cry! these Shepherds Weeds lay down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Change Crooks for Scepters! Garlands for a Crown!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But sure that Crown does far less easie sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than Wreaths of Flow'rs, less innocent and sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor can thy Beds of State so gratefull be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those of Moss, and new faln Leaves with me!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now tow'rds the Beach we go, and all the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Groves, the Fern, dark Woods, and springs survey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That were so often conscious to the Rites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sacred Love, in our dear stoln Delights.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Eyes all languishing, each place you view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sighing cry, <i>Adieu, dear Shades, Adieu!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then 'twas thy Soul e'en doubted which to doe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refuse a Crown, or those dear Shades forego!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory and Love! the great dispute pursu'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the false Idol soon the God subdu'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now on Board you go, and all the Sails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are loosned, to receive the flying Gales.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst I, half dead on the forsaken Strand,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld thee sighing on the Deck to stand,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wafting a thousand Kisses from thy Hand.</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whilst I cou'd the lessening Vessel see,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And all the Sea-born <i>Nereids</i> implore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick to return thee to our Rustick shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now like a Ghost I glide through ev'ry Grove,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent, and sad as Death, about I rove,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And visit all our Treasuries of Love!</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Shade th'account of thousand Joys does hide,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The print, where thee and I so oft have lain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon this Oak thy Pipe, and Garland's plac'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Sicamore is with thy Sheephook grac'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here feed thy Flock, once lov'd though now thy scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like me forsaken, and like me forlorn!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A Rock there is, from whence I cou'd survey</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From far the blewish Shore, and distant Sea,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hanging top with toyl I climb'd each day,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With greedy View the prospect I ran o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see what wish'd for ships approach'd our shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day all hopeless on its point I stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw a Vessel bounding o'er the Flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as it nearer drew, I cou'd discern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich Purple Sails, Silk Cords, and Golden Stern;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the Deck a Canopy was spread</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Antique work in Gold and Silver made,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which mix'd with Sun-beams dazling Light display'd.</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh! beneath this glorious Scene of State<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Curst be the sight) a fatal Beauty sate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fondly you were on her Bosome lay'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst with your perjur'd Lips her Fingers play'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wantonly curl'd and dally'd with that hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which, as sacred Charms, I Bracelets wear.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! hadst thou seen me then in that mad state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So ruin'd, so desig'd for Death and Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fix'd on a Rock, whose horrid Precipice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hollow Murmurs wars with Angry Seas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst the bleak Winds aloft my Garments bear,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruffling my careless and dishevel'd hair,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I look'd like the sad Statue of Despair.</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With out-strech'd voice I cry'd, and all around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Rocks and Hills my dire complaints resound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rent my Garments, tore my flattering Face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose false deluding Charms my Ruine was.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mad as the Seas in Storms, I breathe Despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Winds let loose in unresisting Air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raging and Frantick through the Woods I fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>Paris!</i> lovely, faithless <i>Paris</i> cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the Echos sound thy Name again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I change to new variety of Pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that dear name such tenderness inspires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turns all Passion to Loves softer Fires:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears I fall to kind Complaints again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Tempests are allay'd by Show'rs of Rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Say, lovely Youth, why wou'dst thou thus betray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My easie Faith, and lead my heart astray?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I might some humble Shepherd's Choice have been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I that Tongue ne'er heard, those Eyes ne'er seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in some homely Cott, in low Repose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Liv'd undisturb'd with broken Vows and Oaths:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day by shaded Springs my Flocks have kept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in some honest Arms at night have slept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then unupbraided with my wrongs thou'dst been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe in the Joys of the fair Grecian Queen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Stars do rule the Great? no sooner you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Became a Prince, but you were Perjur'd too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are Crowns and Falshoods then consistent things?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And must they all be faithless who are Kings?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods be prais'd that I was humbly born,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Even th&ocirc; it renders me my <i>Paris</i> scorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I had rather this way wretched prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than be a Queen and faithless in my Love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not my fair Rival wou'd I wish to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come prophan'd by others Joys to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spotless Maid into thy Arms I brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untouch'd in Fame, ev'n Innocent in thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst she with Love has treated many a Guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brings thee but the leavings of a Feast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With <i>Theseus</i> from her Country made Escape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst she miscall'd the willing Flight, a Rape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So now from <i>Atreus</i> Son, with thee is fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still the Rape hides the Adult'rous Deed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is it thus Great Ladies keep intire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Vertue they so boast, and you admire?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this a Trick of Courts, can Ravishment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serve for a poor Evasion of Consent?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard shift to save that Honour priz'd so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst the mean Fraud's the greater Infamy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much more happy are we Rural Maids,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I lov'd, and all Love's Dictates did pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never thought it cou'd be Sin with you.<br /></span>

<h3>                             INTRODUCTION.
</h3>

<p><i>Le Voyage de l'Isle d'Amour</i>, that dainty fantasy which has been so admirably
translated by Mrs. Behn, is the work of Paul Tallemant, a graceful French
litt&eacute;rateur, who was born at Paris, 18 June, 1642. He was brought up in
circumstances of affluence and even prodigal luxury until the extravagances
and dissipations of both grandfather and father left him whilst yet young in
a state of indigence. He thereupon took orders, but, as was not unusual at
the time, devoted much attention to art and literature, becoming well known
in society for his songs, ballads, idylls, pastorals, and even gallant little
operas in which he never ceased to burn incense to the King. He proved
so successful that at twenty-four in 1666 he succeeded to the place of
Gombaud in the Academy. His chief title to literary renown at that date
was none other than <i>Le Voyage de l'Isle d'Amour</i>. Colbert, his patron, procured
for him a pension of 500 crowns, the abbeys of Ambierle and Saint-Albin,
together with various other posts affording no small emoluments.
Tallemant became a popular preacher and society flocked to hear his fashionable
discourses. He frequently counted the Queen and Princes of the blood
amongst his auditors. He died of an apoplexy in his seventy-first year.
His poems, always neat and elegant, can hardly be claimed to have any
great value, although they never fail to please. Mrs. Behn has indeed greatly
improved upon her original. <i>Le Voyage de l'Isle d'Amour</i> was first printed at
Paris, 12mo, 1663. It was reprinted in <i>Le Recueil de pi&egrave;ces galantes</i>; Cologne,
12mo, 1667; again, 'A Leyde. Chez Abraham Gogat.' 12mo, 1671. <i>Le
Voyage et la Conqueste de l'Isle d'Amour, le Passe-Partout des Coeurs</i> appeared
at Paris 'chez Augustin Besoigne' 1675. With the sub-title <i>La Clef des Coeurs</i>
it was issued from van Bulderen's press at the Hague in 1713, 12mo. So it
will be seen that the little book enjoyed no small popularity. The best edition
is that in volume XXVI of the collection entitled <i>Voyages Imaginaires, Songes,
Visions, et Romans Cabalistiques</i>. Amsterdam, 1788. It is illustrated by an
exquisitely graceful plate of C. P. Marillier at the lines</p>

<span class="i0">Dispers'd it self through every trembling Limb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cou'd not hide our tender new surprize,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus gaz'd we&mdash;when the Sacrifice perform'd,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And open'd every Sally to the Foe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to secure my doubting happiness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Permits me to conduct her to the <i>Bow'r of Bliss</i>.<br /></span>

<p>This Epistle Dedicatory which humbly lays this Little Volume at your
Lordships feet, and begs a Protection there, is rather an Address than a Dedication;
to which a great many hands have subscrib'd, it Presenting your
Lordship a Garland whose Flowers are cull'd by several Judgments in which
I claim the least part; whose sole Ambition is this way to congratulate
your Lordships new Addition of Honour, that of the Most Noble Order of
the <i>Thistle</i>, an Honour which preced's that of the <i>Garter</i>, having been supported
by a long Race of Kings, and only fell with the most Illustrious of
Queens, whose memory (which ought to be Establish'd, in all hearts can
not be better preserv'd,) than by reviving this so Ancient Order; well has
His Majesty chosen its Noble Champions, among whom none merits more
the Glory of that Royal Favor than your Lordship: whose Loyalty to His
Sacred Person and interest through all the adversities of Fate, has begot you
so perfect a veneration in all hearts, and is so peculiarly the Innate vertue
of your Great mind; a virtue not shewn by unreasonable fits when it shall
serve an end, (a false Bravery for a while when least needful, and thrown
off when put to useful Tryal; like those who weighing Advantages by Probabilities
only, and fancying the future to out-poyse the present, cast there
their Anchor of Hope,) but a virtue built on so sure and steady Basis's of
Honour, as nothing can move or shake; the Royal Interest being so greatly
indeed the Property of Nobility, and so much even above life and Fortune:
Especially when to support a Monarch so truly just, so wise and great; a
Monarch whom God Almighty Grant long to Reign over Us, and still to
be serv'd by men of Principles so truly Brave, as those that shine in your
Lordship.</p>

<p>Pardon, my Lord, this Digression and the meanness of this Present, which
to a Person of your Lordships great and weighty Employments in the world
may seem Improper, if I did not know that the most Glorious of States-men
must sometimes unbend from Great Affairs, and seek a diversion in trivial
Entertainments; Though Poetry will Justle for the Preeminency of all
others, and I know is not the least in the Esteem of your Lordship, who is so
admirable a Judge of it, if any thing here may be found worthy the Patronage
it Implores, 'twill be a sufficient Honour to,</p></blockquote>

<h3>LYCIDUS:

or, the Lover in Fashion, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>I Have receiv'd your melancholy Epistle, with the Account
of your Voyage to the <i>Island of Love</i>; of your Adventures
there, and the Relation of the death of your <i>Aminta</i>: At
which you shall forgive me if I tell you I am neither
surpris'd nor griev'd, but hope to see you the next Campagne,
as absolutely reduc'd to reason as myself. When
Love, that has so long deprived you of Glory, shall give
you no more Sighs but at the short remembrances of past
Pleasures; and that after you have heard my Account of
the Voyage I made to the same place, with my more
lucky one back again, (for I, since I saw you, have been
an Adventurer) you will by my Example become of my
Opinion, (notwithstanding your dismal Tales of Death
and the eternal Shades,) which is, that if there be nothing
that will lay me in my Tomb till Love brings me thither,
I shall live to Eternity.</p>

<p>I must confess 'tis a great Inducement to Love, and
a happy Advance to an Amour, to be handsom, finely
shap'd, and to have a great deal of Wit; these are Charms
that subdue the Hearts of all the Fair: And one sees but
very few Ladies, that can resist these good Qualities,
especially in an Age so gallant as ours, yet all this is nothing
if Fortune do not smile: And I have seen a Man handsom,
well shap'd, and of a great deal of Wit, with the
advantage of a thousand happy Adventures, yet finds himself
in the end, fitter for an Hospital than the Elevation
of Fortune: And the Women are not contented we should
give them as much Love as they give us, (which is but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
reasonable,) but they would compel us all to Present
and Treat 'em lavishly, till a Man hath consumed both
Estate and Body in their Service. How many do we see,
that are wretched Examples of this Truth, and who have
nothing of all they enjoyed remaining with 'em, but a poor
<i>Id&aelig;a</i> of past Pleasures, when rather the Injury the Jilt
has done 'em, ought to be eternally present with 'em.
Heaven keep me from being a Woman's Property. There
are Cullies enough besides you or I, <i>Lysander</i>.</p>

<p>One would think now, That I, who can talk thus
Learnedly and Gravely, had never been any of the number
of those wretched, whining, sighing, dying Fops, I speak
of, never been jilted and cozen'd of both my Heart and
Reason; but let me tell those that think so, they are mistaken,
and that all this Wisdom and Discretion, I now
seem replenish'd with, I have as dearly bought as any
keeping Fool of 'em all. I was Li'd and flattered into Wit,
jilted and cozen'd into Prudence, and, by ten thousand
broken Vows and perjured Oaths, reduced to Sense again;
and can laugh at all my past Follies now.</p>

<p>After I have told you this, you may guess at a great
part of my Story; which, in short, is this: I would needs
make a Voyage, as you did, to this fortunate Isle, and
accompanyed with abundance of young Heirs, Cadets,
Coxcombs, Wits, Blockheads, and Politicians, with a
whole Cargo of Cullies all, nameless and numberless we
Landed on the Inchanted Ground; the first I saw, and
lik'd, was charming <i>Silvia</i>; you believe I thought her fair
as Angels; young, as the Spring, and sweet as all the
Flowers the blooming Fields produce; that when she
blush'd, the Ruddy Morning open'd, the Rose-buds blew,
and all the Pinks and Dazies spread; that when she sigh'd
or breath'd, <i>Arabia's</i> Spices, driven by gentle Winds,
perfum'd all around; that when she look'd on me, all
Heaven was open'd in her Azure Eyes, from whence
Love shot a thousand pointed Darts, and wounded me all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
over; that when she spoke, the Musick of the Spheres,
all that was ravishing in Harmony, blest the Adoring
Listener; that when she walk'd, <i>Venus</i> in the Mirtle
Grove when she advanced to meet her lov'd <i>Adonis</i>,
assuming all the Grace young Loves cou'd give, had not
so much of Majesty as <i>Silvia</i>: In fine, she did deserve,
and I compared her to all the Fopperies, the Suns, the Stars,
the Coral, and the Pearl, the Roses and Lillies, Angels
Spheres, and Goddesses, fond Lovers dress their Idols in.
For she was all, fancy and fine imagination could adorn
her with, at least, the gazing Puppy thought so. 'Twas
such I saw and lov'd; but knowing I did Adore, I made
my humble Court, and she, by all my trembling, sighings,
pantings, the going and returning of my Blood, found all
my Weakness and her own Power; and using all the
Arts of her Sex, both to ingage and secure me, play'd all
the Woman over: She wou'd be scornful and kind by
turns, as she saw convenient, This to check my Presumption
and too easy hope; That to preserve me from the
brink of despair. Thus was I tost in the Blanket of Love,
sometimes up, and sometimes down, as her Wit and
Humour was in or out of tune, all which I watch'd, and
waited like a Dog, that still the oftner kick'd wou'd fawn
the more.</p>

<p>Oh, 'tis an excellent Art this managing of a Coxcomb,
the Serpent first taught it our Grandam <i>Eve</i>: and <i>Adam</i>
was the first kind Cully: E're since they have kept their
Empire over Men, and we have, e're since, been Slaves.
But I, the most submissive of the whole Creation, was
long in gaining Grace; she used me as she meant to keep
me, Fool enough for her Purpose. She saw me young
enough to do her Service, handsom enough to do her
Credit, and Fortune enough to please her Vanity and
Interest: She therefore suffer'd me to Love, and Bow
among the Crowd, and fill her Train. She gave me hope
enough to secure me too, but gave me nothing else, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
she saw me languish to that degree, she feared, to lose the
Glory of my Services, by my death; only this Pleasure kept
me alive, to see her treat all my Rivals with the greatest
Rigour imaginable, and to me all sweetness, exposing their
foibles; and having taken Notice of my Languishment,
she suffered me Freedoms that wholly Ravish'd me, and
gave me hopes I shou'd not be long a dying for all she
cou'd give.</p>

<p>But, since I have a great deal to say of my Adventures
in passing out of this <i>Island of Love</i>: I will be as brief as
I can in what arrived to me on the Place; and tell you,
That after Ten thousand Vows of eternal Love on both
sides, I had the Joy, not only to be believ'd and lov'd, but
to have her put herself into my Possession, far from all my
Rivals: Where, for some time I lived with this charming
Maid, in all the Raptures of Pleasure, Youth, Beauty, and
Love could create. Eternally we loved, and lived together,
no day nor night separated us, no Frowns interrupted our
Smiles, no Clouds our Sun-shine; the Island was all perpetual
Spring, still flowery and green, in Bowers, in Shades,
by purling Springs and Fountains, we past our hours, unwearied
and uninterrupted. I cannot express to you the
happy Life I led, during this blessed Tranquility of Love,
while <i>Silvia</i> still was pleased and still was gay. We walked
all day together in the Groves, and entertained ourselves
with a thousand Stories of Love; we laught at the foolish
World, who could not make their Felicity without Crowds
and Noise: We pitied Kings in Courts in this Retirement,
so well we liked our Solitude; till on a day, (blest
be that joyful day, though then 'twas most accurst,) I say
upon that day, I know not by what accident I was parted
from my Charmer, and left her all alone, but in my absence,
there incountred her a Woman extremely ugly, and who
was however very nice and peevish, inconstant in her
temper, and no one place could continue her: The finest
things in the World were troublesom to her, and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Shagreen at every thing; her Name is <i>Indifference</i>; she
is a Person of very great Power in this Island, (though
possibly you never incountred her there,) and those that
follow her, depart from the <i>Isle of Love</i> without any great
pains. She brought <i>Silvia</i> to the Lake of Disgust, whether,
in persuing her (at my return,) I found her, ready to take
Boat to have past quite away, and where there are but too
many to transport those Passengers, who follow <i>Indifference</i>
over the Lake of <i>Disgust</i>. I saw this disagreeable Creature
too, but she appeared too ugly for me to approach her,
but forcing <i>Silvia</i> back, I returned again to the Palace of
<i>True Pleasure</i>, where some days after there arrived to me
a Misfortune, of which, I believed I should never have
seen an end. I found <i>Silvia</i> inviron'd round with new
Lovers, still adoring and pleasing her a thousand ways,
and though none of 'em were so rich, so young, or so
handsom as I, she nevertheless failed not to treat 'em with
all the Smiles and Caresses 'twas possible to imagin; when
I complain'd of this, she would satisfy my fears with so
many Vows and Imprecations, that I would believe her,
and think myself unreasonable, but when she would be
absent whole days, in a hundred places, she would find
such probable Excuse, and lye with such a Grace, no
mortal cou'd have accused her, so that all the whole Island
took notice that I was a baffled Cuckold, before I could
believe she would deceive me, so heartily she damn'd herself:
Through all the Groves I was the pointed Coxcomb,
laught at aloud, and knew not where the jest lay; but
thought myself as secure in the Innocence of my deceiving
fair one, as the first hour I Charmed her, and like a keeping
Cully, lavish'd out my Fortune, my plenteous Fortune,
to make her fine to Cuckold me. 'Sdeath! how I scorn
the Follies of my Dotage; and am resolv'd to persue Love
for the future, in such a manner as it shall never cost me
a Sigh: This shall be my method.</p>

<p>I was a great while, (like you,) before I forgot the
remembrance of my first Languishments, and I almost
thought (by an excess of Melancholy,) that the end of
my Misfortunes were with my Life at hand: Yet still
like a fond Slave, willing to drag my Fetters on, I hop'd
she would find Arguments to convince me she was not
false; and in that Humor, fear'd only I should not be
handsomly and neatly jilted. Could she but have dissembled
well, I had been still her Cully. Could she have
play'd her Game with discretion, but, vain of her Conquest,
she boasted it to all the World, and I alone was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
the kind keeping Blockhead, to whom 'twas unperceived,
so well she swore me into belief of her Truth to me.
Till one day, lying under a solitary Shade, with my sad
Thoughts fixt on my declining Happiness, and almost
drown'd in Tears, I saw a Woman drest in glorious
Garments, all loose and flowing with the wind, scouring
the Fields and Groves with such a pace, as <i>Venus</i>, when
she heard her lov'd Youth was slain, hasted to behold her
ruin. She past me, as I lay, with an unexpressible swiftness,
and spoke as she run, with a loud Voice. At her
first approach, I felt a strange trembling at my Heart without
knowing the reason, and found at last this Woman
was <i>Fame</i>. Yet I was not able to tell from whence proceeded
my Inquietude. When her Words made me but
too well understand the Cause: The fatal Subject of what
she cry'd, in passing by me, were these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Poor <i>Lycidus</i>, for shame arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wipe <i>Loves</i> Errors from thy Eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shake off the God that holds thy Heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since <i>Silvia</i> for another burns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all thy past Indurement scorns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thou the Cully art.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I believed, as she spoke, that I had ill understood her,
but she repeated it so often, that I no longer doubted my
wretchedness. I leave you, who so well can guess, to
imagin, what Complaints I made, filling the Grove, where
I was laid, with my piteous Cries; sometimes I rose and
raved, and rail'd on Love, and reproached the fair Fugitive.
But the tender God was still pleading in my Heart,
and made me ever end my noisy Griefs in Sighs and silent
Tears. A thousand Thoughts of revenge I entertained
against this happy Rival, and the charming ingrate: But
those Thoughts, like my Rage, would also end in soft
reproaching murmurs and regret only. And I would
sometimes argue with Love in this manner.</p>

<p>Though I complained thus for a good while, I was not
without some secret hope, that what I had heard was not
true; nor would I be persuaded to undeceive myself of
that hope which was so dear and precious to me. I was
not willing to be convinced I was intirely miserable,
out of too great a fear to find it true; and there were
some Moments in which I believed <i>Fame</i> might falsly
accuse <i>Silvia</i>, and it did not seem reasonable to me, that,
after all the Vows and Oaths she had made, she should
so easily betray 'em, and forgetting my Services, receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
those of another, less capable of rend'ring them to her
advantage. Sometimes I would excuse her ingratitude
with a thousand things that seem'd reasonable, but still
that was but to make me more sensible of my disgrace;
and then I would accuse myself of a thousand weaknesses
below the Character of a Man; I would even despise and
loath my own easiness, and resolve to be no longer a <i>Mark-out-fool</i>
for all the Rhiming Wits of the Island to aim
their Dogrel at. And grown, as I imagined, brave at this
thought, I resolved first to be fully convinced of the perfidy
of my Mistress, and then to rent my Heart from the
attachment that held it.</p>

<p>You know, that from the <i>Desart of Remembrance</i>, one
does, with great facility, look over all the <i>Island of Love</i>.
I was resolved to go thither one day; and where indeed
I could survey all things that past, in the Groves, the
Bowers, by Rivers, or Fountains, or whatever other place,
remote or obscure 'twas from thence, that one day I saw
the faithless <i>Silvia</i>, in the Palace of <i>True Pleasure</i>, in the
very Bower of Bliss with one of my Rivals, but most
intimate Friend.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>In fine, 'twas there I saw that I must lose the day. And
I saw in this Lover Ten thousand Charms of Youth and
Beauty; on which the ingrate with greedy languishing
Eyes, eternally gazed with the same Joy she used to behold
me when she made me most happy. I confess, this
Object was so far from pleasing me, (as I believed a confirmation
would,) that the change inspired me with a rage,
which nothing else could do, and made me say things
unbecoming the Dignity of my Sex, who ought to disdain
those faithless Slaves, which Heaven first made to obey
the Lords of the Creation. A thousand times I was about
to have rush'd upon 'em, and have ended the Lives of the
loose betrayers of my repose, but Love stepp'd in and
stay'd my hand, preventing me from an Outrage, that
would have cost me that rest of Honour, I yet had left:
But when my rage was abated, I fell to a more insupportable
Torment, that of extream Grief to find another possest
of what I had been so long, and with so much Toil in
gaining: 'Twas thus I retir'd, and after a little while
brought myself to make calm Reflections upon this Adventure,
which reduced me to some reason. When one day
as I was walking in an unfrequented Shade, whither my
Melancholy had conducted me, I incountred a Man, of
a haughty look and meen, his Apparel rich and glorious, his
Eyes awful, and his Stature tall; the very sight of him inspired
me with coldness, which render'd me almost insensible
of the infidelity of <i>Silvia</i>. This Person was <i>Pride</i>, who
looking on me, as he past, with a fierce and disdainful Smile,
over his Shoulder, and regarding me with scorn, said;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why shou'd that faithless wanton give<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy Heart so mortal pain,<br /></span>

<p>I knew by his words he was <i>Pride</i>, or <i>Disdain</i>, and
would have embraced him; but he put me off, seeing <i>Love</i>
still by me, who had not yet abandoned me, and turned
himself from me with a regardless scorn, but I, who was
resolved not to forsake so discreet a Counsellor, rather
chose to take my leave of little <i>Love</i>; who had ever accompanyed
me in this Voyage. But oh! this adieu was
not taken so easily and soon as I imagined. <i>Love</i> was not
to be quitted without abundance of Sighs and Tears at
parting, he had been a Witness to all my Adventures, my
Confident in this Amour, and not to be deserted without
a great deal of pain; I stayed so long in bidding the dear
Boy adieu, that I had almost forgot <i>Disdain</i>; at last,
though my Heart were breaking to part with the dear
fondling, I was resolved and said;</p>

<p>In quitting <i>Love</i> I was a great while before I could find
<i>Disdain</i>, but I, at last, overtook him: He accompanyed
me to a Village, where I received a Joy I had not known
since my Arrival to the <i>Isle of Love</i>, and which Repose
seemed the sweeter because it was new. When I came to
this place, I saw all the World Easie, Idle, and at Liberty:
This Village is like a Desart, and all the Inhabitants live
within themselves, there is only one Gate, by which we
enter into it from the <i>Isle of Love</i>.</p>

<p>This place is called <i>Indifference</i>, and takes its Name
from a Princess inhabiting there, a Person very fair and
well made; but has a Grace and Meen of so little Wit,
and seems so inutile and so silly, that it renders her even
ridiculous. As soon as I arrived there, I called to my
remembrance all those affronts and cheats of Love, that
<i>Silvia</i> had put upon me, and which now served for my
diversion, and were agreeable thoughts to me; so that
I called myself Ten thousand Sots and Fools for resenting
'em; and that I did not heartily despise 'em, laugh at 'em,
and make my Pleasure with the false One as well as the
rest; for she dissembled well, and for ought I knew, 'twas
but dissembled Love she paid my Rivals. But I, forsooth,
was too nice a Coxcomb, I cou'd not feed as others did,
and be contented with such Pleasures as she cou'd afford,
but I must ingross all, and unreasonably believe a Woman
of Youth and Wit had not a longer Race of Love to run
than to my Arms alone. Well, 'tis now confest I was a
Fool, nor could I hinder myself from saying a thousand
times a day;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That Coxcomb can ne're be at ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While Beauty inslaves his Soul.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis Liberty only can please,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he that's Fetter'd is an Owl.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I found it very convenient and happy to dis-ingage from
Love, and I have wond'red a thousand times at the Follies
that God has made me commit: And though I som'times
thought on <i>Silvia</i>, I thought her less charming and fair
than she was before her fall; and the Humour I now was
in represented her no more meriting that Passion I once
had for her, and I fancied she had lost all those Graces
for which once I lov'd her: In fine, I was so wholly
recovered of my disease of Love for <i>Silvia</i>, that I began
to be uneasie for want of employing my Addresses; and
a change from so violent a Passion to such a degree of
coldness, became insupportable to one of my Youth and
I natural Gayety; insomuch, that I was seized with a Dulness,
or Languishment, and so great a fit of Melancholy,
as I had never felt the like; and my Heart, that was so
accustomed to Love, was so out of Humour, that it had
no Object or Business for thought, that it lost all its Harmony
and Wit; it having nothing to excite it to Life
and Motion, passing from so vast a degree of tenderness
to an unconcern equally extream. I thought it rude, ill-bred,
and idle, to live so indifferent and insignificant a Life.
And walking perpetually by myself, (or with those of my
own Sex, that could not make my diversion,) I sung all
day this following Song to a Hum-drum Tune, to myself;</p>

<p>These were my notions of Life; and I found myself
altogether useless in the World without Love; methought
I had nothing to animate me to Gallant things, without
Love, or Women: I had no use of Wit or Youth without
the fair, and yet I did not wish wholly to ingage myself
neither a second time, having been so ill-treated before by
Love: But I found there were ways to entertain one's self
agreeably enough without dying or venturing the breaking
of a heart for the matter: That there were Beauties
to be obtained without the hazard of hanging or drowning
one's self: I never had tried, but I found it natural enough
to my Humour and Constitution, to flatter and dissemble,
swear and lye; I viewed my self in my Glass, and found
myself very well recovered from the Ruins my first Amour
had made, and believed myself as fit for Conquest, as any
Sir <i>Fopling</i>, or Sir <i>Courtly Nice</i> of 'em all. To this fine
Person and good Meen and Shape, (as I thought,) I added
handsom Dressing, the thing that takes the Heart infinitely
above all your other Parts, and thus set out a snare for vain
Beauty; I every day went out of the City of <i>Indifference</i>,
to see what new Adventures I could meet withal.</p>

<p>One day I incountred a Woman, who, at first sight
appeared very agreeable; she had an Air easie, free, and
Galliard; such as fails not to take at first view: This was
<i>Coquettre</i>, who, the very first time she saw me, Addrest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
herself to me with very great Complisance and good Humour,
and invited me to her Apartment, where she assured
me I should not fail to be entertained very agreeably; and
at the same time pulling out of her Pocket a Paper, she
shewed me these Words written;</p>

<p>This agreeable description, gave me new desire to enter
into the City; where I incountred a thousand fine Persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
all gloriously drest, as if they were purposely set out for
Conquest: There was nothing omitted of Cost and Gallantry,
that might render 'em intirely Charming, and they
employ'd all their Arts of Looks and Dress to gain Hearts.</p>

<p>It is, in a word, from these fair Creatures you are to
draw your Satisfaction, and 'tis indeed at a dear rate you
buy it, yet, notwithstanding the Expence, a world of
People persue 'em.</p>

<p>When I came into the City, I was soon perceived to
be a Stranger there, and while I was considering whither
I should go, or how to address myself to these fair Creatures,
a little <i>Coquette Cupid</i> presented himself to me for a kind
Instructer; and to explain him, this in a word is his
Character:</p>

<p>He is of the same Race with the other <i>Cupids</i>, has the
same Mother too, <i>Venus</i>: He wears a Bow and Arrows,
like the rest of the young Loves; but he has no Bando,
nothing to cover his Eyes, but he sees perfectly; nor has
he any <i>Flambeau</i>: And all the Laws of <i>Coquettre</i> he understands
and observes exactly.</p>

<p>I had no sooner received the little Charming God, but
he instructed me in all the most powerful Arts to please,
in all his little wiles and agreeable deceits; all which he
admits of as the most necessary Recourses to that great
end of Man, his true diversion: With all which I was so
extreamly pleased, that resolving to be his Votary, I followed
him to the most delightful place in the World, the
City of <i>Gallantry</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gallantry</i> is a City very magnificent; at the Entrance
of the Gate you incounter <i>Liberality</i>, a Woman of great
Wit, delicate Conversation and Complisance: This Lady
gives her Passport to all that enter, and without which, you
cannot pass, or at least, with great difficulty; and then too
you pass your time but very ill; and the more Pasports
you have, the better you are received from the fair Inhabitants,
and pass your time more agreeable with the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Conversation you meet with in this City. Love told me
this, and it was therefore that I took a great many Pasports
from this acceptable Person <i>Liberality</i>. But what renders
you yet more Favoured by the Fair and the Young
who reside at <i>Gallantry</i>, is, to have a delicate soft Wit, an
assiduous Address and a tender way of Conversing; but
that which best cullies and pleases the Generality of People
there, is <i>Liberality</i> and <i>Complisance</i>: This place of so great
Divertisement is re-frequented with all the Parties of the best
and most amiable Company, where they invent a thousand
new Pleasures every day; Feasting, Balls, Comedies, and
Sports, Singing and Serenades, are what employs the whole
Four and twenty hours.</p>

<p>By the Virtue of my Pasports from <i>Liberality</i>, I was
introduced to all the fine Conversations and Places that
afford Pleasure and Delight: I had the good Fortune to
make Parties, insomuch, that I was soon known to all the
Company in the City, and past the day in Feasting, going
with the Young and Fair to delightful <i>Villa's</i>, Gardens,
or Rivers in Chases, and a thousand things that pleas'd;
and the Nights I passed in Serenading, so that I did not
give myself time for Melancholy; and yet for all this I was
wearied and fatigued; for when once one has tasted of
the Pleasure of Loving and being Beloved, all, that comes
after that, is but flat and dull; and if one's Heart be not
a little inflamed, all things else are insignificant, and make
but very slight touches.</p>

<p>I began therefore for all this to be extreamly Shagreen
and out of Humour, amidst all these Pleasures, till one
lucky day I met with an Adventure, that warmed my
Heart with a tender flame which it had not felt since
my happy beginning one for <i>Silvia</i>: One day, as I said,
I was conducted by my officious <i>Cupid</i> into a Garden very
beautiful, where there are a thousand Labyrinths and Arbours,
Walks, Grotto's, Groves and Thickets; and where
all the Fair and the Gay resorted; 'twas here I incountred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
a young Beauty called <i>Bellinda</i>; she was well made, and
had an admirable meen, an Air of Gayety and Sweetness;
but that which charmed me most of all, was her Wit,
which was too ingaging for me to defend my Heart against:
I found mine immediately submitting to her Conversation,
and you may imagine I did not part with her so long as
Decency and good Manners permitted me to stay with
her, which was as long as any Company was in the place;
nor then, till by my importunity I had gained so much
upon her to suffer my Visits, which she did with a Condescention
that gave me abundance of hope.</p>

<p>I was no sooner gone, but my <i>Cupid</i>, who took care of
me, and entertained me to the best Advantage, carried
me that Evening to a Ball, where there were a world of
Beauties, among the rest one fair as imagination can conceive;
she had all the Charmes of Youth and Beauty;
though not so much Wit and Air as <i>Bellinda</i>. To this young
adorable I made my Court all the time I remained there,
and fancied I never found myself so Charmed, I fancied
all the Graces had taken up their dwelling in her Divine
Face; and that to subdue one so fair and so innocent,
must needs be an extream Pleasure: Yet did I not so
wholly fix my desires on this lovely Person, but that the
Wit of <i>Bellinda</i> shared my Heart with the Beauty and
Youth of <i>Bellimante</i>, so was this young Charmer called:
I was extreamly well pleas'd to find I could anew take
fire; and infinitely more, when I found I should not be
subdued by one alone; nor confined to dull Dotage on a
single Beauty; but that I was able to attain to the greatest
Pleasure, that of Loving two amiable Persons at once:
If with two, I hoped I might with Two score if I pleas'd
and had occasion; and though at first it seemed to be very
strange and improbable to feel a Passion for two, yet I
found it true, and could not determin which I had the
greatest tenderness for, or inclination to: But 'tis most
certain, that this night I found, or thought I found, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
for <i>Bellimante</i>, who fired me with every Smile; I confess
she wanted that Gayety of Spirit <i>Bellinda</i> had, to maintain
that fire she raised: And ever when I was thoughtful
a moment, <i>Coquettre</i> (who is ever in all the Conversation,
and where she appears very magnificent and with a great
Train,) would, smiling, sing softly in my Ear this Song,
for she is very Galliard;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cease to defend your Amorous Heart,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><i>Coquettre</i> is a Person, that endeavours to please and
humour every Body, but of all those who every day fill her
Train, she caresses none with that Address and Assiduity
as she did me, for I was a new Face, to whom she is ever
most obliging and entertaining. However, notwithstanding
the Advice of <i>Coquettre</i>, I fancied this young Charmer
had engaged all my Soul; and while I gazed on her Beauty,
I thought on <i>Bellinda</i> no more; but believed I should
wholly devote myself to <i>Bellimante</i>, whose Eyes alone
seemed capable to inflame me.</p>

<p>I took my leave with Sighs, and went home extream
well pleas'd with this days Adventure. All this Night
I slept as well as if no tenderness had toucht my Heart,
and though I Lov'd infinitely, it gave me no disturbance;
the next morning a thousand pleasant things <i>Bellinda</i> had
said to me, came into my mind, and gave me a new
inclination to entertain myself with that witty Beauty;
and dressing myself in haste with the desire I had to be
with her, I went again, the morning being very inviting,
to the Garden, where before I had seen her, and was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
lucky to encounter her; I found her blush at my approach;
which I counted a good Omen of my future happiness;
she received me with all the Gayety and Joy good liking
and Wit could inspire: Nor was I backward on my part,
but addrest myself to her with all imaginable respect, and
as much Love in my Eyes as I was able to put on; which,
I found, she saw with Pleasure; she had not entertained
me half an hour, but I was so absolutely charmed, that
I forgot there was a <i>Bellimante</i> in the World.</p>

<p>Thus for several days I lived; every day visiting both
these attracting Beauties, and at Night, when I was retired,
was not able to inform myself which I liked best: Both
were equally beloved, and it was now, that methought
I began to tast of true Joy; I found myself in Love without
any sort of inquietude; when I was Melancholy, I went
to visit <i>Bellinda</i>, and she with her Gayety and Wit would
inspire me with good Humour; If I were over-prest with
good Company, and too much Conversation and Noise,
I would visit <i>Bellimante</i>, who by a certain softness in her
discourse, and a natural Languishment in her Eyes and
Manners, charmed and calmed me to a reposed tranquillity;
so that to make me fortunate in Love, I could not
have fixed my desires better: I had too little Love to be
wretched, and enough to make my happiness and Pleasure.</p>

<p>After I had past my time awhile thus in <i>Coquettre</i>, this
little Love, who was my Guide, carried me to <i>Declaration</i>:
I thought then upon the time of my first Arrival on the
<i>Isle of Love</i>; and how <i>Respect</i>, that awful hinderer of our
Pleasure, prevented me from going to this Place: I urg'd
this very argument <i>Respect</i> then made me, to my <i>Coquet</i>
Love now, who for answer return'd me nothing but loud
Laughter; and when I askt his reason, he replied, that
<i>Respect</i> did not forbid any to go to <i>Declaration</i>, but those
only who knew not how to behave themselves well there,
and who were not so well fashion'd and bred as they ought
to be, who go thither: And that it was a mere cheat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
<i>Respect</i> to conduct people to <i>Love</i> by <i>Discretion</i>, that being
much the farthest way about, and under favor to Monsieur
<i>Respect</i> he is but a troublesome companion to a Lover,
who designs to cure those wounds the fair has given him,
and, if he have no better counsellor, he may languish all
his life without revealing the secret of his soul to the object
belov'd, and so never find redress. But this Sir <i>Formal</i>,
(<i>Respect</i> says <i>Love</i>,) is a very great favourite of the Lady's,
who is always in fee with them as a Jilt with a Justice;
who manages their Fools just as they wou'd have 'em;
for it is the most agreeable thing in the World to them,
and what the most feeds their vanity, to see at their feet
a thousand Lovers sigh, burn, and languish; the fair are
never angry to find themselves belov'd, nor ever weary
of being Ador'd. I was extreamly pleas'd at this frank
Humour of my little Love who told me this, and without
much scruple or consideration to <i>Respect</i> I followed him
towards <i>Declaration</i>, and in my way he gave me this
Advice.</p>

<p>By this time we were arriv'd to <i>Declaration</i>, which is
a very little Village, since it is only for Passengers to pass
thr&ocirc;, and none live there, the Country is very Perilous, and
those that make a false step run a great risque of falling
from some precipice: Round about rises a very great mist,
and people have much ado to know each other; of these
mists there are two sorts: The one on the side of <i>Denial</i>,
the other on that of <i>Permission</i>, the first is very disagreeable
and draws a very ill consequence with it; the other directs
you to a place of intire divertisement, but I had so good
a guide that the entrance gave me no trouble at all. When
I came to the Village, I found <i>Bellimante</i>, and <i>Bellinda</i>,
to whom by turns I told all my heart; and discover'd all
its passion or its tenderness which was to me much better.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When to the charming <i>Bellinda</i> I came,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With my heart full of Love and desire,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Of sighing, and dying, and fire,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the slave was undone by the force of her Wit.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And while I was vowing, the ardour of youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made myself even believe what I swore was all Truth.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I confess to you, my dear <i>Lysander</i>, that it was a great
while before I cou'd make myself be believ'd by <i>Bellinda</i>,
or gain any credit upon her heart, she had a great deal of
Wit and cou'd see farther into the designs of her Lovers
than those who had not so much, or had had so many vows
pay'd them: I perceiv'd well enough, I was not hated by
her, and that she had not a heart wholly insensible; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
that I never quitted her till I had gain'd so much upon
her to accompany me to <i>Permission</i>, where for some time
we pass our days very pleasantly; and having so good
fortune with <i>Bellinda</i>, I had now a great desire to try my
power over <i>Bellimante</i>: and where indeed, contrary to my
expectation, I was not so happy: But she went from me
to <i>Denial</i>; and I was for that hour oblig'd to return again
to <i>Bellinda</i>, it was some time I searcht her in vain, but
at last found her at a little Village, extreamly agreeable.
There are very few Inhabitants, but those that are live in
perpetual union, yet do not talk much, for they understand
one another with half words: A sign of the Hand, the
Head or the Eye, a glance or smile is sufficient to declare
a great part of the Inclination. It is here where the
Lover takes all freedoms, without controul, and says and
does all that soft Love can permit: And every day they
take and give a secret Entertainment, speaking a particular
Language, which every body does not understand, and
none but Lovers can reply to; in effect, there are as many
Languages as there are persons.</p>

<p>The Governess of this Village is very charming to those
that are acquainted with her; and as disagreeable to those
that are not; she is a person of a great deal of Wit, and
knows all things. She has a thousand ways to make herself
understood, and comprehends all in a moment, that
you wou'd or can say to her.</p>

<p>In this place, to divert, we make a thousand pretty sorts
of Entertainments; and we have abundance of Artifices,
which signify nothing, and yet they serve to make life
Agreeable and Pleasant.</p>

<p>'Twas thus I liv'd at <i>Intelligence</i>; when I understood
that <i>Bellimante</i> was retir'd to <i>Cruelty</i>. This news afflicted
me extreamly, but I was not now of a humour to swell
the Floods with my tears, or increase the rude winds with
my ruder sighs; to tear my hair and beat my Innocent
breast as I us'd in my first Amour to do. However I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
so far concern'd that I made it my business not to lose
this insensible fair one, but making her a visit in spight
of her retreat, I reproacht her with cruelty.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Why, fair Maid, are you uneasy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When a slave designs to please you;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When he at your feet is lying<br /></span>

<p>Who the Devil wou'd not believe me as much in love
now as I ever was with <i>Silvia</i>: My heart had learnt then
all the soft Language of Love which now it cou'd prattle
as naturally as its Mother Tongue; and sighing and dying
was as ready for my mouth as when it came from my very
heart; and cost me nothing to speak; Love being as
cheaply made now by me as a barter for a Horse or a
Coach; and with as little concern almost: It pleas'd me
while I was speaking, and while I believ'd I was gaining
the vanity and pleasure of a conquest over an unvanquisht
heart. However I cou'd yet perceive no Grist come to
my Mill; no heart to my Lure; young as it was, it had
a cunning that was harder to deceive than all <i>Bellinda's</i>
Wit: And seeing her persist still in her Resolution I left
her with a heart, whose pride more than Passion resented
the obdurat'ness of this Maid, I went as well compos'd
however as I cou'd to <i>Intelligence</i>; and found even some
pleasure in the cruelty and charming resistance of <i>Bellimante</i>,
since I propos'd to myself an infinite happiness in
softening a heart so averse to Love, and which I knew I
shou'd compel to yield some time or other with very little
pains and force.</p>

<p>I feigned nevertheless abundance of Grief to find her still
persist in her rigorous Cruelty; and I made her believe
that all my absent hours I abandoned myself to sorrows
and despairs; though <i>Love</i> knows I parted with all those
things in <i>Silvia's</i> Arms. But whatever I pretended, to
appear at <i>Cruelty</i> and before <i>Bellimante</i>; at <i>Intelligence</i> I
was all Galliard and never in better Humour in my Life
than when I went to visit <i>Bellinda</i>: I put on the Gravity
of a Lover, and beheld her with a Solemn Languishing
Look: In fine, I accustomed myself to counterfeit my
Humour, whenever I found it convenient for my Advantage:
Tears, Vows, and Sighs cost me nothing, and I knew
all the Arts to jilt for Love, and could act the dying Lover,
whenever it made for my Satisfaction.</p>

<p>In fine, after I had sufficiently acted the Languishing
Lover, for the accomplishment of all my Wishes, I thought
it time to change the Scene, and without having recourse
to Pity, I followed all the Counsels of my <i>Cupid</i>; who
told me, that in stead of dying and whining at her Feet,
and damning myself to obtain her Grace, I should affect
a Coldness, and an Unconcern; for, <i>Lycidus</i>, assure yourself,
said he, there is nothing a Woman will not do, rather
than lose her Lover either from Vanity or Inclination.
I thanked <i>Love</i> for his kind Advice; and to persue it, the
next day I drest myself in all the Gayety imaginable: My
Eyes, my Air, my Language, were all changed; and thus
fortified with all the put-on indifference in the World,
I made <i>Bellimante</i> a Visit; and after a thousand things
all cold and unconcerned, far from Love or my former

<p>Having said all this with an Air of Disdain, I, smiling,
took my leave, with much less Civility and Respect than
I used to do: and hasting to <i>Intelligence</i>, I past my time
very well with <i>Bellinda</i>, to whom I paid all my Visits,
and omitted nothing that might make <i>Bellimante</i> know
I had forgot her: But at the end of some days by a very
happy change, she finding more inclination to Love than
to Cruelty, banishing all Obstacles in Favour of a Lover,
she came to <i>Intelligence</i>; where at first sight she made me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
some little Reproaches, and that in so soft a manner, that
I did not doubt but I had toucht her Heart: I swore
a thousand times, that all I had done, was only put on to
see if it were possible she could resent it, and force from
her Heart some little concern for my supposed loss. At
this time I had abundance of Intreagues upon my hands,
for it was not with <i>Bellinda</i> and <i>Bellimante</i>, with whom
I lived in this manner; and indeed it is impossible to remain
at <i>Intelligence</i> and to make a Court but to two Persons only,
where there are so many of the Fair and Young. I writ
every day several Billets; and received every day as many:
I had every day two or three Rendezvous; and one ought
to manage matters very discreetly, that neither Party might
come to the knowledge of the others concern; and one
ought to be a Man of great Address and Subtilty to love
more than one securely; and though this gave me some
pain, it was nevertheless an <i>Embarrass</i> very agreeable, and
in which I could have lived a great while; if Envy, which
cannot suffer any Body to be happy in <i>Intelligence</i>, had not
arrived there and told a great many things which discovered
my Intreagues; so that <i>Bellinda</i>, with whom I had lived
there with great Tranquillity a long time, and <i>Bellimante</i>,
with whom I was but just beginning to be happy, were
both obliged to quit this delightful place, where we enjoyed
many happy hours; and they retired till the noise was
a little over; and with them all those who had afforded
me any hope: If any one of these had stayed, I had been
contented well enough and one might have consol'd me
for the loss of the other, but in one day to lose all that
made my happiness, put me in such a Melancholy, I knew
not for the present what to do for myself; but <i>Coquet Love</i>
conducted me to a Village, that gave me a new Pleasure:
The scituation of it is marvellous, the Fields and the Groves
all about it the most pleasant in the World; the Meadows
enamel'd with Rivulets, which run winding here and there,
and lose themselves in the Thickets and the Woods. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
going, <i>Love</i> said to me: In absence it is in vain to abandon
yourself to sorrow. Alas! What signifies it to sigh night
and day; the Absent does not hear us; nor can the most
tender Affliction or Complaint render a Lover happy, unless
the Fair One were present to hear all his Moans, then perhaps
they might avail. There was reason in what he said,
and I was pleas'd and calm'd; and we arrived at the same
time at this Village: All the Houses were fine, and pleasant,
we saw all the Graces there by Fountains and by Flowery
Springs, and all the Objects that could be imagined agreeable;
and the least amiable ones, we saw, gave us a Joy!
All the World that inhabit there contribute to Diversion;
and this place is called <i>Amusement</i>: <i>Amusement</i> is a young
Boy, who stops and gazes at every thing that meets his
Eyes, and he makes his Pleasure with every Novelty.</p>

<p>As soon as I arrived at this Village I thought to divert
myself, as others did; and to hinder my Thoughts from
fixing on the loss of my two Mistresses, and to banish from
my mind the Chagrins their Absence gave me; withdrawn
from the fair Eyes of <i>Bellimante</i>, and the Charming Wit
of <i>Bellinda</i>, and to give my sighing Heart a little ease;
upon a thousand Objects I formed my desires, and took
a thousand Pleasures to divert my Melancholy: And all
the time I lived at this dear place, I passed my time without
any inquietude; for every day afforded me new Objects
to give me new Wishes. And I now expected, without
much impatience, the return of <i>Bellinda</i> and <i>Bellimante</i>;
nor did I tire myself with writing to 'em every day; and
when I did write, to save the expence of thought, the same
Billet served both; a thousand little tender things I said
of course to both: And sometimes, especially while I was
writing, I thought I had rather seen them than have lived
at <i>Amusement</i>, but since it was necessary they should be
absent, I bore it with all the Patience I could; sometimes
we were in a fit of writing very regularly to one another,
but on a sudden I received no Letters at all; the reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
of this was, they both understood I lived at <i>Amusement</i>, and
had retired themselves to the Palace of <i>Spight</i>: I no sooner
received this News, but I rendered myself there also; it
is a place where there is alwaies abundance of Tumult,
Outrage, Quarrels and Noise: And <i>Spight</i> is a Person who
eternally gives occasion of Discontent and Broil; causing
People often to fall out with those they love most, and
to caress those they hate: But the Quarrels she occasions
us with those we love, last but a very short season, and
Love reconciles those differences that <i>Spight</i> obliges us to
make: Th&ocirc; 'tis sometime pleasant enough to see those
we Love extreamly, and violently, fall into the highest
rage, and say a thousand things injurious and unreasonable,
and to swear all the Oaths that angry Love and Fury can
inspire, never to see or converse with one another again,
and in a moment after to grow calm, weep, and reunite;
to be perjured on both sides, and become more fond than
ever they were.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In this Place there wou'd be eternal War, but for a
person who inhabits there, and is always the Mediator for
Peace, 'tis he that assists to accommodate and bring the
Lovers together. This is a very honest person, call'd <i>Right
Understanding</i>; he brought me to <i>Bellinda</i>, whom I found
accompani'd with a Man that made her a thousand
caresses; at my approach she made as if she knew me not,
which I took in such disdain, that I apply'd myself to <i>Spight</i>,
with a design to be reveng'd on this Haughty scorner.
In this humour I made a visit to <i>Bellimante</i> but found her
as Implacable as <i>Bellinda</i>, whom no excuses, no reason,
cou'd reduce to the temper I had once seen her; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
a rage, ten times more than I was before, fill'd with disdain
and revenge I complain'd of this treatment to my little
<i>Love</i>, who immediately led me into a Grove, where the
Beauties and the Graces us'd to walk, to consult upon
what return to make for my affront; from one place to
another we past on till we came to a little Thicket, on
the other side of which, by a little Rivulet we cou'd hear,
but not see, two persons discoursing; they were women,
and one seemed in a violent Rage against her Lover, who
had newly offended her, whilst the other strove in vain
to reconcile her, but she went on, vowing to revenge herself
with the next object she shou'd Encounter that had
but Wit, Youth, and fortune enough to Justify her Love,
and make her conquest glorious; her resolution agreeing
so with mine, and her manner of speaking, gave me new
hope and pleasure, and a great curiosity to see her face;
I found by her Resentment she was young and of Quality,
and that alone was enough to make me resolve upon
Addressing myself to her, and the other person had no
sooner left her, but I advanced towards her, with as good
a grace as I you'd put on; she was a little surprised, and
blushing at first, but I soon reconcil'd her to my conversation.
I found her handsom enough to ingage me, and
she was as well pleased with me as I was with her, both
having the same design which was that of revenge, and
you may Imagine, our business being the same, our entertainment
was not at first extraordinary, but as my cause
of Anger was more reasonable than hers, I began to find
myself to soften into liking of this new fair one, who
was called <i>Cemena</i>, and who, to spight her former Lover,
endeavor'd to be seen with me in all the publick places
she cou'd, which gave him Infinite torments of Jealousie.
One day as I was walking with this <i>Cemena</i> in a place
where the young and the fair frequent, <i>Bellinda</i> and
<i>Bellimante</i> often passed by us, and saw us both well pleas'd
and in good humour; I cou'd perceive their colour goe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
and come, and that they were as uneasy at this object, as
my heart you'd wish, and by their quitting of the place
immediately after, I was assured of all my hope, and believed
I had gained my Point; at the end of two or three
days, one Morning walking alone in the same place I
encountered <i>Bellimante</i>, who hap'ned to be attended with
her Woman onely; she chang'd colour at my approach,
and wou'd have passed me by but I stay'd her by the Robe;
and said a thousand things to her that angry Love inspir'd
me with, while she on her side did the same, till we had
talk'd ourselves by degrees into reason, and good understanding.
I found her Resentment to be only the excess
of Love, and all those faults are easily forgiven, I immediately
threw myself at her Feet, and made her a thousand
protestations of my fidelity, and she, in her turn excused
herself with all the tenderness imaginable, she made me
a thousand new vows and caresses, and forgot nothing that
might perswade me that all she did was by Counsel of <i>Spight</i>.</p>

<p>I found this accommodement extreamly agreeable, and it
was in these transports the Lovely <i>Bellimante</i> detain'd me
for some days without quitting her, but I found too much
Joy in a new reconciliation not to endeavour to make one
also with <i>Bellinda</i>; as soon then as <i>Bellimante</i> grew a little
off my heart by so long a conversation with one and the
same Woman, I, on pretence of some affairs, left her
extreamly charm'd and satisfi'd, and hasted to <i>Bellinda</i>,
who, methought, was now a new Beauty; at least I found
her too considerable to lose the Glory of ingaging her
intirely; 'tis possible that both these Ladies, being agitated
with as little faith as myself, deceiv'd me with the same
design as I did them, to make their pleasure only, and th&ocirc;
this very often came into my thoughts, yet it gave me no
great inquietude, they dissembl'd well, and I cou'd not see
it; I had the satisfaction and the vanity of 'em, that was
as much as I desir'd from any of the fair since <i>Silvia</i> toucht
my heart, they both swore they lov'd and both fear'd to
displease, if they were unfaithful they had a thousand
stratagems to hide their infidelity, and took a great deal
of care to keep me, which shew'd a value in me above all
the rest of my Rivals, and I beheld myself with some Pride
and esteem for having so much power; when ever they
offended me they had all the Arts to mollify me, and who
wou'd be so critically in love as not to be willing to be so
well abus'd? For my part I will not be so nice, as to
penetrate into their thoughts, to find what wou'd but displease
me if found; but content myself with all I see and
find that looks like Love at least and good humour. Nay
even in their worst I found a thousand pleasures, those of
their quarrels which sometimes happen twenty times a day,
when every reconciliation is like a new Mistress, so well
they strive to please and be reconcil'd.</p>

<p>But all these pleasures did not satisfy me, there were
greater yet behind which I had not arriv'd to with these
fair charmers, and however I liv'd at <i>Amusement</i>, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
a thousand Amours with a hundred of the most Beautiful,
still I had a desire to subdue intirely to my pleasure these
two the most hard to gain, but now I was pretty well secur'd
of both their hearts and yet neither knew they were each
others Rivals in mine. They knew one another, converst,
and play'd and walkt together, yet so discreet I was
in this Amour that neither was jealous of the other, nor
suspected I lov'd both with an equal Ardour; when I hap'ned
to be with 'em both I carried myself so equally Gallant
that both commended my conduct and imagin'd I did it
to hide the secret passion I had for herself, and so many
little Arts my <i>Coquet Love</i> had taught me I cou'd with ease
manage abundance of intrigues at one and the same time.</p>

<p>But as I said, this did not suffice, nor cou'd the fires
that some more willing Beauties allay'd, hinder me from
wishing and burning and persuing those two fair persons
with an Ardor that had no appearance of decay from
any others goodness to me, but in my daily visits to 'em
I eternally solicited them to suffer me to accompany them
to that charming place call'd <i>Favors</i>, which is a very
Beautiful Castle rais'd in a Vally. I confest to you that
my <i>Coquet Cupid</i> advis'd me not to go, for fear of attaching
myself too much to a place so extreamly agreeable; the
Mountains, that environ this Castle, are very high and full
of hollow Rocks, which made the scituation very sullen.
The Castle itself was delicately built, and surrounded with
tall Trees, so thick that one cou'd hardly see the Edifice,
nor cou'd the Sun-beams dart throw the gloomy shade;
and eternal Night seem'd to sit there in awful state and
pleasure: For the more obscure this place is and secret
from all Eyes, the better and more acceptable it is to all
that enter there, and th&ocirc; this Vally have many inhabitants,
it appears to have none at all; because they love solitude,
and, banishing all Publick society, content themselves only
to be but two in company together; if there be more they
are receiv'd with a very ill welcome, for a third Person in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
this place wou'd destroy the Pleasure and the harmony. The
Inhabitants of this Castle never shew themselves but to
those that are very importune, and then not every day, the
Ladies that command there are many Sisters all of the name
of the Castle; and all very fair, and still one more fair
than the other, and when you visit 'em you see 'em not
all at once but by degrees and the last you behold is the
fairest, and by the pleasure you have in seeing one, you
desire to see 'em all. For there are no limits to be given to
desire, and as they are never seen by any body altogether,
it happens very often that you see but one, and you must
have address and great assiduity, abstinence, and good
fortune to obtain one of these <i>Favors</i>; but the last will
cost you much more trouble than all the rest put together,
so very fair, so very nice and coy she is: But when once
obtain'd she brings you to the Palace of intire Pleasure;
which is neighbouring to the Castle of <i>Favors</i>; but I, who
wou'd very fain, at once, have brought to this delicate
place both <i>Bellinda</i> and <i>Bellimante</i>, found myself extream
uneasy, because, as I said, only two can be well entertain'd
at a time! I found it against my humour and against the
advice of <i>Love</i> to abandon all, and retire with one only,
for in decency and good manners, those, who go to this
Castle of <i>Favors</i>, are oblig'd to continue there for some
time; and I found, I shou'd be extreamly chagrin after
a little with one alone; but both were obstinate and wou'd
not suffer a third: and having been so very importune
with both, I was asham'd to repent and recant all those
things I had said, to persuade them to go, th&ocirc; in my heart
I was very ill satisfi'd I had not persu'd the counsel, <i>Love</i>
had given me not to go to <i>Favors</i> at all; he foreseeing an
inconvenience in such a retreat, which I, with all my
young desires about me and fond of novelty, cou'd not,
so well as he, discern; however I had propos'd it with
some ardency and wou'd not go back, but resolv'd to make
the best advantage of my voyage, and wou'd not declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
my regreet till I cou'd no longer hinder it: So that <i>Bellimante</i>,
yeilding to my Implorings, consented next day to
go with me to this retreat of <i>Favors</i>.</p>

<p>Accordingly the next morning we set out for this
amiable place; where we arrived, and finding myself all
alone, without interruption or fear, with this very fair
Creature, I advanced to a thousand Freedoms which she,
with some resistance, permitted me to take: I was all Joy
and Transport at every advance, and still the nearer I approached
to the last Favour, the more blest I imagined
myself; I grew more resolved, and she more feeble;
and at last, I was the Victor and <i>Bellimante</i> the Victim;
I remained some days with her, and one would have
imagined I should have been intirely happy in this place
with one so young and fair: But behold the fickleness of,
Youth, and Man's nature.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Th&ocirc; my Heart were full of Passion,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I found the yeilding Maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give a loose to inclination<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thought, if Beauty pleas'd me so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What must Wit and Beauty too?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And though next day I found myself a hundred times
more in Love with <i>Bellimante</i> than before, yet unless I
could possess <i>Bellinda</i> too, I thought myself miserable:
Yet every time she charmed me anew I was upon the
point of renouncing eternally <i>Bellinda</i>, and sacrificing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
to my Passion for <i>Bellimante</i>: But I did not remain long
in that Humour, but every day grew more and more
unresolved in that point; and as <i>Bellimante</i> grew more
fond I grew more cold; not but I had learnt to say so
many kind and soft things in the time of my real Passion
with <i>Silvia</i>, that I found it easie to speak every day such
endearing Words as gave her no doubt of my Heart; nor
was willing she should see to the bottom of it, where she
would most certainly have found <i>Bellinda</i>; yet with such
a mixture of Passion for herself, that it would have been
hard to have distinguished, which had had the ascendant
there; only my desire at present was the most considerable
for the fair Object I had not yet possest, and whom
I long'd to vanquish; perhaps, as much for the Glory as
the Pleasure, though my Heart did not at this moment
think so.</p>

<p>After some time that I had lived here with <i>Bellimante</i>,
I made some pretext to leave her for a little while; she,
who was extreamly charmed with that Solitude, resolved
to wait there my return, so that I had some pain in contriving
how I should bring <i>Bellinda</i> to the same Castle as
I wished to do; but it had in it many Mansions and
Apartments, and, as I said, so retired from one another,
that it was difficult to come at any time together or to
meet: This consideration made me resolved, and very
pressing with <i>Bellinda</i>, to go to this place, assuring her of
such Diversion as she never met with in any other part of
the World: She loved and was not long in persuading, and
I had the Glory to conduct her in spight of all her Wit
and Gayety, to this retreat of Solitude with me; where,
unperceived, I obliged her to render me all that Love could
allow, and more than Honour would permit: And I was
for some days extreamly happy, and possibly had continued
so, (going from one Apartment to another, and, like the
Great Sultan, visiting by turns my Beauties,) had not
a malicious fate prevented my Grandeur and Pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>It hap'ned one day that I had sued a repetition of Favours
from <i>Bellinda</i>; she seeming resolved to grant me no more,
repenting of those I had taken, and with a charming
Sorrow reproaching me, making me a thousand times more
pressing than before: At last her force growing weaker,
her denials fainter, and my importunities more raging;
I found her yeilding, the Lily in her Face gave place to
the Roses, and Love and Trembling made her Eyes more
fair, and just ready to render me all. We saw approaching
us <i>Bellimante</i>, who, having heard how I sometimes past
my hours, resolved to surprise me in my perfidy; and
accordingly found us in a gloomy Arbour with all the
Transports of Love in both our Faces, which it was too
late to resettle and hide from this too sensible and jealous
fair One: In vain I strove with all the Arguments of Love
and Tenderness to appease her, or, if by anything I said,
I found her inclined to pardon me, on the other side it
but served to incense and enrage <i>Bellinda</i>, to whom I had
made equal Vows (at her coming to that place,) of eternal
Fidelity. I am not able to express to you, my dear <i>Lysander</i>,
what confusion I found myself in, I divided my Heart
and my Entreaties between 'em; and knew not to which
I most ardently meant 'em; I was very sensible, that while
I treated both with equal Love and Respect, that I should
gain neither, and yet if what I said to both had been addrest
to any one of 'em, it would have prevailed; and I found
it easie to have kept either, if I would resolve to quit the
other; but my heart not inclining to that, or if it wou'd,
not knowing which I shou'd chuse, made me remain
between 'em both the most out-of-countenanced coxcomb,
that ever was taken in the cheats of Love, while both were
on either side reproaching me with all the malice and noise
imaginable, so that not being able longer to endure the
clamour, I took my flight from 'em both, and ran with all the
force I cou'd to a Village call'd <i>Irresolution</i>; and where <i>Coquet
Love</i> abandon'd me saying that place was not proper for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>The Houses of this Village are for the most part not
half built, but all appears very desolate and ruinous: It
appertains to a Lady very fantastique of the same name.
She makes a Figure pleasant enough, she never dresses
herself, because she cannot determin what habit to put
on; she is ever tormenting herself, still turning to this side
and to that, yet never stirs from the place, because undetermin'd
she knows not whither nor which way to go: And
having so many in her mind resolves to go to neither; one
always sees an Agitation in her Eyes, that keeps them in
perpetual motion and fixt on nothing. You see her perpetually
perplext with a thousand designs in her head at
once, but puts none of them in execution.</p>

<p>I found myself in this place Embarrassed with a thousand
confusions and thoughts, for <i>Bellinda</i> and <i>Bellimante</i> had
equally shar'd my soul, and I knew not for which I shou'd
declare; nor whether the Wit and extream good Humour
of the first were more powerful upon my heart, than the
Beauty and softness of the last, so that I was wholly unable
to determin which I shou'd quit, having the same sentiments
for one as the other, and resolv'd to abandon both
rather than content myself with one: And the fear of
losing one was the occasion of my losing both, in fine
I was in the most cruel incertainty in the World. And
I cou'd not forbear saying a thousand times to myself,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When <i>Love</i> shall two fair objects mix,<br /></span>

<p>While I was thus perplext betwixt these two violent
passions, when no reason cou'd resolve me which to choose,
as I was one day meditating what to do in this extremity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
a Woman presented herself to me, whose Beauty was infinitely
transcending all I had ever beheld; she had a noble
and Majestick meen, a most Divine Air, and her charms
cast so great a Lustre that I was dazzl'd with Gazing on
her; she struck me with so profound a respect at the first
sight of her Glory's, that I cou'd not forbear throwing
myself at her feet, imploring I might be eternally permitted
to Adore her; and to become her slave. When
raising me from the ground, and looking on me with Eyes
more Majestick than kind, she said to me in a loud voyce:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Those words, repeated to me with an Air haughty and
imperious, toucht me to the very Soul, and made me blush
a thousand times with shame to behold myself in that
ridiculous state, almost reduc'd to the same tenderness for
<i>Bellinda</i> and <i>Bellimante</i> I had before had for <i>Silvia</i>; but
I soon found my error and in an instant became more in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Love with Glory than I had ever been in my life. Insomuch
that I resolv'd to leave <i>Irresolution</i> and follow her.
I confess at first it gave my heart som little pain to withdraw
and dis-ingage it from so long and so fond a custom,
and I was more than once forc'd to parley thus with my
intractable and stubborn heart.</p>

<p>Thus, my dear <i>Lysander</i>, following Glory, I soon arriv'd
at the extent of the Island of <i>Love</i>, and there I incounter'd
a thousand Beauties, Attractions, Graces and Agreements;
all which endeavor'd anew, but in vain, to engage me.
I past by 'em all without any regard only sight, as I beheld
'em with the remembrance, how once the meanest of
those Beauties wou'd have charm'd me. I lookt back on
all those happy shades, who had been conscious of my
softest pleasures, and a thousand times I sighing bid 'em
farewell; the Rivers, Springs and Fountains had my wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
that they might still be true and favor Lovers, as they had
a thousand times done me. These dear remembrance,
you may believe, stay'd some time with me, yet I wou'd
not for an Empire have return'd to 'em again, nor have
liv'd that life over anew I had so long and with so much
pleasure persu'd.</p>

<p>After this I took a Vessel and put off from that shore,
where, th&ocirc; I had met with many Misfortunes, I had also
receiv'd a thousand joys: While it was in view I found
myself toucht with some regret, but being sail'd out of
sight of it, I sigh'd no more, but bid adieu to fond Love
for ever.</p>

<h3>
To<br />
SIR WILLIAM CLIFTON.
</h3>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sir,</span></p>

<p>I am very sensible how the ill-natur'd World has been pleased to Judge of
almost all Dedications, and when not addrest to themselves will not let 'em
pass without the imputation of Flattery; for there is scarce any Man so just
to allow those Praises to another in which he does not immediately share in
some degree himself, nor can the Fantastic Humors of the Age agree in point
of Merit, but every Mans Vertue is measured according to the sence another
has of it, and not by its own intrinsic value, so that if another does not see
with my Eyes and judge with my Sence, I must be Branded with the Crime
of Fools and Cowards; nor will they be undeceived in an Error that so agreeably
flatters them, either by a better knowledge of the Person commended,
or by a right understanding from any other Judgment; they hate to be convinced
of what will make no part of their satisfaction when they are so, for
as 'tis natural to despise all those that have no vertue at all, so 'tis as natural
to Envy those we find have more than our selves instead of imitating 'em:
and I have heard a Man rail at a Dedication for being all over Flattery, and
Damn it in gross, who when it has been laid before him, and he has been asked
to answer according to his Conscience, and upon Honour to every particular,
could not contradict one single Vertue that has been justly given there, yet
angry at being convinced has cry'd, with a peevish, uneasie tone.&mdash;YET
I DON'T KNOW HOW, NOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT-BUT 'TIS
ALL TOGETHER METHINKS A PIECE OF FLATTERY&mdash;When
indeed the business was, <i>he did not know how</i> to afford him so good a Character,
nor <i>he did not know what</i> other reason he had to find fault with it, and was
only now afflicted to find 'twas all true; whereas before he charged it all on
the effects of some little sinister end or advantage of the Author.</p>

<p>'Tis therefore, Sir, that I have taken the Liberty here of addressing my self
to one, whose Generosity and Goodness has prevented any such Scandal, and
secured me from the imputation of Flattery by rend'ring this, but a small part
of that Duty only, which I have so long owed you; 'tis only, Sir, my debt
of gratitude I pay, or rather an humble acknowledgment of what I ought to
pay you; for favours of that nature are not easily returned, and one must be
a great while discharging it out of the Barren Stock of Poetry; but where
my own failed, I borrowed of my Friends, who were all ready to give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
Credit for so good and just an occasion, and we all soon agreed where first
we should begin the work of gratitude. For, Sir, your worth is every where
known, and valued; it bears the Royal stamp and passes for currant to every
ready hand; Loyalty being that standard Vertue of the Soul which finds its
price all over the World; nor is it in these our glorious days, who bears that
Rate now, but who has always done so through Fate and Fortune; dyed in
the true Grain, not to be varied with every glittering Sun-shine, nor lost in every
falling Shower, but stanch to its first beautiful colour, endures all weathers.</p>

<p>Nor is it enough that where you are known, you are beloved and blest,
but you, whose Quality and Fortune elevate you above the common Crowd,
ought to have your Loyal Names fixed every where, as great and leading
Examples to the rest, as the Genius of your Country and the Star that influences,
where your Lustre shines. You, who in spight of all the Follies we
import from <i>France</i> so much in fashion here, still retain, and still maintain
the good old <i>English</i> Customs of Noble Hospitality, and treat the underworld
about you, even into good nature and Loyalty; and have kept your
Country honest, while elsewhere for want of such great Patrons and Presidents,
Faction and Sedition have over-run those Villages where Ignorance abounded,
and got footing almost every where, whose Inhabitants are a sort of Bruits,
that ought no more to be left to themselves than Fire, and are as Mischievous
and as Destructive. While every great Landlord is a kind of Monarch that
awes and civilizes 'em into Duty and Allegiance, and whom because they
know, they Worship with a Reverence equal to what they would pay their
King, whose Representative they take him at least to be if not that of God
himself, since they know no greater or more indulgent; and are sure to be
of his opinion, he's their Oracle, their very Gospel, and whom they'll sooner
credit; never was new Religion, Misunderstanding, and Rebellion known in
Countries till Gentlemen of ancient Families reformed their way of living to
the new Mode, pulled down their great Halls, retrenched their Servants, and
confined themselves to scanty lodgings in the City, starved the Poor of their
Parish, and rackt their Tenants to keep the Tawdry Jilt in Town a hundred
times more expensive, but you, Sir, retain still the perfect measure of true
Honour, you understand the joys and comforts of life and blest retreat; you
value Courts tho you do not always shine there, you dare be brave, liberal,
and honest tho you do not always behold the Illustrious Pattern of all
Glorious Vertue in your King, and absent from the lavish City. You are
pleased and contented with the favour of your Monarch, tho you have no
need of his Bounty, dare serve him with your Life and Fortune, and can find
your reward in your own Vertue and Merit; this I dare avow to all the
World is your Character in short, for which your lasting Name shall live,
when the turbulent, busie hot-brain'd disturbers of their own tranquillity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
and the Kingdoms Peace, shall live in fear, die in Shame and their memory
rot in the forgotten Grave, or stand to after Ages Branded and Reproached,
while we can never enough Celebrate that Glorious one of yours; nor knew
we where to fix it to render it Durable to all Eternity so well as to lasting
Verse, that out-wears Time and Marble. If anything within can contribute
to the diversion of your Hours of least concern, 'twill be sufficient recompence
to all who beg your Patronage here, especially</p>

so long in the Country: I am sorry your Taste is so

<span class="i0">And each kind Youth diverts his smiling Fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if by Chance is found a flinty Maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose cruel Eyes has Shepherds Hearts betray'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In other Climes a Refuge she must find,<br /></span>

</h3>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_4">4</a>, l. 1 <i>To Peter Weston, Esq.</i> This Epistle Dedicatory and the five complimentary
poems which follow are only in the editio princeps, 1686.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_94">94</a>, l. 4 <i>Sent from Damon to Iris</i>. 1697, 1735 both omit this. 1697 on
separate title reads: 'The Whole Art of Charming.'</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_95">95</a>, l. 18 <i>Iris's</i>. 1697, 1735 'The Lady's'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_106">106</a>, l. 26 <i>Love and Truth</i>. 1735 'Love and Youth'.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Poems Upon Several Occasions (1684).</span></h3>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_115">115</a>, l. 3 <i>Viscount Cramborn and Baron of Islington</i>. So 1684; but
'Cramborn' should be 'Cranborn', and for 'Islington' we should read
'Essingdon.' Possibly Mrs. Behn sent the Dedicatory Epistle to press
as an afterthought at the last moment and did not see a proof. Though
she was frequently careless, such mistakes as 'Cramborn' and 'Islington'
would seem to be chargeable to her printers.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>, l. 32. <i>Forsake their Kinds</i>. Query 'their Kids'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_130">130</a>, l. 33. <i>E'er they're</i>. 1684 'E'er their'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_139">139</a>, l. 5. <i>The Gray-Plum'd Natives of the Shades</i>. So 1684, but we
should doubtless read 'Gay-Plum'd'. cf. l. 2 of sixth stanza: 'little
Gay-wing'd Loves.'</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>, l. 11 <i>The Sun and Spring receive but our short Light</i>. This, the
reading of 1684, is clearly corrupt but can be easily mended by
changing 'receive' to 'revive'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_147">147</a>, l. 8 <i>the rushing of the wind-blown leaves</i>. On p. 171, l. 23, we have
'Whispering Gales Sigh through the Rushing Leaves.' Mrs. Behn uses
'rushing' in the sense of 'rustling'.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_150">150</a>, l. 17 <i>From Active Joyes with some they hast</i>. The words 'with some'
are meaningless and corrupt. Query 'eftsoon'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_154">154</a>, l. 25 <i>Like Pan, a Majesty</i>. 1684 'Like Panna, Majesty'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_177">177</a>, l. 15 <i>Gold and Grain</i>. Probably a misprint for 'Golden Grain'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_181">181</a>, l. 21 <i>Priapus</i>. 1684 'Priapas'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_182">182</a>, l. 11 <i>All that the Gods e'er made, if Fair</i>. Query 'e'er made of Fair'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_183">183</a>, l. 28 <i>Astrae</i>. Misprint: the old copy rightly gives 'Astrea.'</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_183">183</a>, l. 30 <i>I slept. Muses Mercury</i> (May, 1707), 'I saw last night a pretty
sight'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_183">183</a>, l. 32 <i>Stars</i>. M.M. 'Eyes so bright'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_186">186</a>, l. 5 <i>are</i>. Misprint: read, with the old copy, 'art.'</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_194">194</a>, l. 31 <i>Not add</i>. Query 'Not au' (i.e. Not all).</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_200">200</a>, l. 17 <i>were throng</i>. Query 'were throng'd'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_206">206</a>, l. 20 <i>decry</i>. Misprint: read, with 1684, 'descry'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_207">207</a>, l. 12 <i>and Kill</i>. 1684 'a Kill'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_218">218</a>, l. 1 <i>we part</i>. 1684 'me part'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_219">219</a>, l. 14 <i>thee and I</i>. The bad grammar has not been changed, as it may
be due to Mrs. Behn's carelessness.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_222">222</a>, l. 2 <i>Hadst</i>. 1684 'Hads'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_224">224</a>, l. 25 <i>That, best instructs</i>. 1684 'instruct'. (The comma after 'that'
is unnecessary, but Mrs. Behn used it to emphasise the word&mdash;here
and in the following line.)</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_225">225</a>, l. 12 <i>ne'er to visit more</i>. 1684 'near to visit more'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_227">227</a>, l. 4 <i>whether</i>. i.e. (as frequently) 'whither'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_230">230</a>, l. 28 <i>barely wishing</i>. Query 'dearly wishing'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_230">230</a>, l. 33 <i>Love gives</i>. 1684 'give'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_231">231</a>, l. 18 <i>treads</i>. 1684 'tread'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_232">232</a>, l. 32 <i>Kisses</i>. 1684 'Kiss'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_233">233</a>, l. 13 <i>Mad</i>. 1684 'Made'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_235">235</a>, l. 17 <i>In modest Speech, as might well subdue</i>. Corrupt. Query 'Modest
in Speech, such as might well subdue.'</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_247">247</a>, l. 2 <i>Says</i>. 1684 'Say'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_250">250</a>, l. 5 <i>replies</i>. 1684 'reply'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_251">251</a>, ll. 1-2 <i>the dumb and silent languishes, Are predic'd, which so well
explain the Heart</i>. The word 'predic'd' is very suspicious. Taking
'languishes' as a substantive (and deleting the comma), we might
change 'predic'd' to 'produc'd' (with the accent on the first syllable).</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_253">253</a>, l. 3 <i>Winter</i>. 1684 'Winters'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_253">253</a>, l. 7 <i>All bleek and cale</i>. In a <i>Pastoral to Mr. Stafford</i>, (p. 383), we
have: 'In summer let the Boughs be <i>cale</i> and dry.'</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_258">258</a>, ll. 1-2 <i>who's lovely Face Disdain'd the Beauties of the common race</i>. So
1684; but 'Disdain'd' may be a misprint for 'Distain'd' (outshone).</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_272">272</a>, l. 28 <i>And let her Feet weep my neglect away</i>. Corrupt. We should
doubtless read 'And at her Feet weep my neglect away'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_273">273</a>, l. 10 <i>hear</i>. 1684 'here'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_278">278</a>, l. 5 <i>hallow'd</i>. 1684 'hollow'd'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_280">280</a>, l. 10 <i>wear</i>. 1684 'were'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_284">284</a>, l. 7 <i>Inspiring Love, inciting</i>. 1684 'Inspiring my Love inciting.'</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_285">285</a>, l. 28 <i>soft breath'd</i>. 1684 'oft breath'd'.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>


<h3>LYCIDUS (1688).</h3>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_302">302</a>, l. 35 <i>no one place could continue her</i>. So 1688; but 'continue' may
be a misprint for 'contain'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_327">327</a>, l. 4 <i>Now</i>. 1688 'How'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_344">344</a>, l. 18 <i>This there</i>. 1688, but query ''Tis there'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_345">345</a>, l. 19 <i>wert</i>. 1688 'wers't'.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_352">352</a>, l. 23 <i>'Twas youth, 'twas wit, 'twas Beauty</i>. 1688 'was Beauty'.</p>

was born in 1665. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford,
and afterwards proceeding to the Inner Temple (1683) was called to
the Bar in 1697. He attained considerable eminence in his profession.
Foster, <i>Alumni Oxon</i>. has: 'Weston, Peter s. Tho. of Chester (city)
cler. Brasenose Coll. matric. 10 June 1681 aged 16; bar. at law Inner
Temple, 1697.' The Inner Temple <i>Admission Register</i> gives: 'Petrus
Weston. Generosus filius secundus Thome Weston nuper de Christalton
in Comitatu Cestrie Sacre Theologie Professoris generaliter Admissus
est in Societatem istius Comitive in consideracione Trium librarum
Sex solidorum etc. etc. Septimo die Februarii Anno Domini 1683
(i.e. 1683/4).' In the Inner Temple <i>Records</i>, amongst the Bench Table
Orders, is noted, 27-9 January, 1696-7: 'that Peter Weston be called
to the bar', and again 31 January following, we have: 'Peter Weston's
call to the bar respited.' Doubtless Weston was a friend of Hoyle,
and by him introduced to the circle which surrounded Mrs. Behn.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_7">7</a> <i>Charles Cotton</i>. Charles Cotton was born at Ovingdean (Sussex),
28 April, 1630. Upon coming into his estate he found it heavily
encumbered, and probably as much from necessity as from natural
inclination turned to literary work. He produced a large number of
poems, translations, panegyrics, prominent amongst which is his
<i>Scarronides, or Virgil Travestie</i> (1664). He will be remembered by his
best lyrics, his Second Part of the <i>Compleat Angler</i>, and his version
of Montaigne. Cotton, who seems to have been continually harassed
with pecuniary difficulties, was a gay liver, albeit an intimate of Isaak
Walton. He died 1687.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_7">7</a> <i>two Orinda's</i>. 'The matchless Orinda' was Mrs. Katherine Philips
(<i>n&eacute;e</i> Fowler), pr&eacute;cieuse and poetess (1631-64). After marriage the
lady divided her time between London and her husband's house at
Cardigan, where she was the centre of a circle of admirers and friends
who adopted various fanciful names, e.g. Silvander (Sir Edward Dering),
Antenor (her husband). Her verses and a translation of Corneille's
<i>Pomp&eacute;e</i> (Dublin, 1663) became famous. At the height of her popularity
she died of smallpox at a house in Fleet Street, 22 June, 1664. For
an excellent account of her see Gosse, <i>Seventeenth Century Studies</i>.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_8">8</a> <i>N. Tate</i>. Nahum Tate, born in Dublin, 1652, was educated at Trinity
College. He does not appear to have followed any definite profession.
Coming to London he produced much miscellaneous literary work, and
was even entrusted by Dryden with a portion of the second part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
<i>Absalom and Achitophel</i> (1682), the master himself enriching it with
some two hundred lines. Tate succeeded (24 December, 1692) Shadwell
in the laureateship which he did not hold till his death (12 August,
1715) as Rowe was appointed to that post, 1 August, 1715. His
plays are perhaps not so mediocre as they are often judged to be, but
they have been damned by his outrageous mangling of King Lear (1681),
which, none the less, persevered on the stage for many a long decade.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Perhaps he is chiefly known for this, and a version of the Psalms (the
first twenty appeared in 1695) written in conjunction with Nicholas
Brady (1696).</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_75">75</a> <i>Varrio</i>. Antonio Verrio, the celebrated Neapolitan painter, was born
at Lecce, in the Terra di Otranto, about 1639. His earliest pictures
were done for ecclesiastics&mdash;the Jesuits College, Naples, the high altar
in the Carmelite Church, Toulouse. His facility of execution and rich
colouring gained him fame, and Charles II appointed him to direct the
royal tapestry works at Mortlake. Soon, however, Verrio was transferred
to Windsor to paint the walls and ceilings. Under Charles II and his
successor Verrio was in high favour. At the Revolution he threw up
his office of surveyor of the royal gardens (a sinecure) and refused to
employ his pencil for William of Orange. He had, however, many
commissions from nobles and private persons. His sight failing, Queen
Anne bestowed on him a pension of &pound;200 a year. He died 1707. A
list of Verrio's ceilings will be found in Jesse's <i>Eton and Windsor</i>. Pope,
<i>Windsor Forest</i>, has a couplet (307-8):&mdash;</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_75">75</a> <i>Gibbon</i>. Grinling Gibbons, the celebrated sculptor in wood, was born
at Rotterdam, 4 April, 1648. He came to London in 1667. He was
first brought into notice by Evelyn, who introduced him to the King.
Charles II gave Gibbons a place in the board of works. Besides being
employed at Windsor, Gibbons decorated other of the royal palaces
in marble sculpture as well as wood. His exquisite carvings are to
be found in many noble houses. They are unrivalled for their presentment
of foliage, fruit, flowers; of a marvellous delicacy and beauty. In
1714 he was appointed master carver to George I. He died at his
house in Bow Street, 3 August, 1721.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_76">76</a> <i>noble Clifdon</i>. Evelyn, 23 July, 1679, writes: 'To Court: after dinner
I visited that excellent painter, Verrio, whose works in <i>fresco</i> in the
King's palace, at Windsor, will celebrate his name as long as those
walls last.... I went to Clifden, that stupendous natural rock,
wood, and prospect, of the Duke of Buckingham's, buildings of extraordinary
expense. The grots in the chalky rock are pretty: it is
a romantic object, and the place altogether answers the most poetical
description that can be made of solitude, precipice, prospect, or whatever
can contribute to a thing so very like their imaginations. The
stand somewhat like Frascati as to its front, and, on the platform, is
a circular view to the utmost verge of the horizon which, with the
serpenting of the Thames, is admirable. The staircase is for its
materials singular; the cloisters, descents, gardens, and avenue through
the wood, august and stately; but the land all about wretchedly barren,
and producing nothing but fern. Indeed, as I told his Majesty that
evening (asking me how I liked Clifden) without flattery, that it did
not please me so well as Windsor for the prospect and park, w<sup>ch</sup> is
without compare; there being but one only opening and that narrow,
w<sup>ch</sup> led one to any variety, whereas, that of Windsor is everywhere
great and unconfined.'</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_76">76</a> <i>Sir Samuel Morland, or Sir Robert Gorden</i>. Sir Samuel Morland, the
celebrated inventor and projector, was born in 1625. Having served
the Commonwealth, he turned royalist, and on Cromwell's death joined
the King at Breda. He was rewarded at the Restoration with a
baronetcy, a pension, and the appointment of Master of Mechanics to
the King. He devoted himself to practical science, and his house was
long the resort of the curious to view his models, inventions, &amp;c. In
a MS. (Harleian) treatise he shows an accurate knowledge of steam
power and explains how it can be employed to work cylinders in
raising water, a subject to which he had paid particular attention,
having brought water from a considerable distance to the top of Windsor
Castle. He died blind and in penury, 30 December, 1695.</p>

<p><i>Sir Robert Gordon</i>, Bart. was born 7 March, 1647. He became
famous for his scientific pursuits, and in the neighbourhood of Gordonstown
(Elginshire), his birthplace, he was long known as 'Sir Robert the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
Warlock'. A MS. account of the family says: he was 'particularly
skilled in mechanics and chemistry.... He contrived a curious
machine or pump for raising water, w<sup>ch</sup> was tried in the Fleet and
highly approved of, and found far to exceed anything of that kind then
known, both for the facility of working and the quantity of water
it discharged.' Gordon sat in the Scotch parliament, and seems to
have been a favourite with James II, who was interested in his
experiments. He died 1704.</p>

Viscount Cranbourn, was the eldest son of James, 3rd Earl of Salisbury,
and Margaret, daughter of John Manners, Earl of Rutland. He married
Frances, one of the three daughters and coheiresses of Simon Bennet
of Beechampton, Bucks, when she was only thirteen years old. A firm
Tory, he was in 1688-9 committed to the Tower as a recusant, but
the prosecution was waived. His name was forged by Robert Young
to a document purporting to be that of an Association to seize the
Prince of Orange, and declare for King James. On this account he
was a second time committed to the Tower, 7 May, 1692, but as
nothing could be proved his bail was soon formally discharged in the
Court of King's Bench. He died 25 October, 1693, leaving an only
son, three years old, who succeeded him. He was buried at Hatfield,

three days before the Act of Uniformity was passed, but he still held
forth with unabated zest and vigor in meeting-houses and conventicles
whenever opportunity offered. He was imprisoned 28 February,
1684-5 on a charge of libelling the Church in his <i>Paraphrase of the
New Testament</i> (1685). His sermons, devotional and other writings
amount to nearly two hundred.</p>

King's College, Cambridge. He proceeded B.A. 1682, M.A. 1686, and
is mentioned as a Professor of Theology, whence we infer that he took
Orders. In 1712 he was 'Collegii Regalis Praepositus'. He prefixed a
copy of complimentary verses (1 January, 1682), to Creech's <i>Lucretius</i>,
and was also a contributor to Dryden's <i>Miscellany</i>.</p>

<p>John Adams, the celebrated topographer, who in 1680 laboriously
drew up the <i>Index Villaris</i>, a gazetteer dedicated to Charles II, was a
barrister of the Inner Temple, and must be carefully distinguished
from the Cambridge litterateur.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_123">123</a> <i>T. C.</i> i.e. Thomas Creech, who was born at Blandford, Dorset,
1659. In Lent Term, 1675, he was admitted as a commoner at
Wadham College, Oxford. Having studied hard he graduated M.A.
13 June, 1683 (B.D. 18 March, 1696), and was elected a Fellow of
All Souls, 1 November, 1683. For two years (1694-6) he was headmaster
of Sherborne, and then returned to Oxford. Melancholia, however,
grew upon him, and after accepting the college living of Welwyn
(where he never resided) he committed suicide, his body being discovered
(June, 1700), in a garret in his lodging at the house of an apothecary
named Ives. Creech's translation of <i>Lucretius</i> was printed at Oxford,
1682. It is of value, and Munro in his edition of the poet speaks of his
predecessor as 'a man of sound sense and good taste', no mean praise
from so great a scholar.</p>

diocese of Salisbury. About 1662 he migrated to London and became
a pupil of Sir Peter Lely. Almost instant success awaited him, and his
progress proved so rapid as to excite the master's jealousy. He married
early, and was at first industrious. After a few years, however, he
became a boon companion of the free-living theatrical and literary
circles of the day, and fell into irregular habits. 19 May, 1676, whilst
returning from the Vine Tavern, Greenhill fell into the gutter in Long
Acre, was carried to his lodging in Lincoln's Inn Fields where he died
that same night. He is buried in St. Giles-in-the-Fields. Amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>

so many of her poems are addressed. In <i>The Muses Mercury</i> for

they will become a <i>Nuisance</i>.'</p>

prefixed to this edition by Waller, Evelyn, Otway, Tate, Duke and
others.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_168">168</a> <i>The Learned Thirsis</i> is Thomas Sprat (1635-1713), the famous
Bishop of Rochester and Dean of Westminster, who matriculated from
Wadham, 12 November, 1651, and 25 September, 1652, was elected
a scholar. He graduated B.A. 25 June, 1654, M.A. three years later.
He took his B.D. and D.D. 3 July, 1669. From 30 June, 1657 to
24 March, 1670 (when he resigned), he held a Wadham fellowship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
Cowley, in his <i>Ode to the Royal Society</i>, had praised Sprat's <i>History of
the Royal Society of London</i> (1667), and when Cowley died, in 1667,
Sprat wrote <i>An Account of the Life of Mr. Abraham Cowley.</i></p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_169">169</a> <i>Strephon the Great</i> is John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester (1647-80),
who was admitted a fellow commoner at Wadham, 18 January,
1659-60. He was created M.A. 9 September, 1661, when little more
than fourteen. The four silver pint pots he presented to his college
are still preserved.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_171">171</a> <i>To Mrs. W.</i> i.e. Anne Wharton, born in Oxfordshire about 1632,
second daughter and coheiress of Sir Henry Lee, third baronet of
Ditchley, by Anne, daughter of Sir John Danvers of Cornbury;
16 September, 1673, she married as his first wife Thomas Wharton
(afterwards first Marquis of Wharton), to whom she brought &pound;10,000
dowry and &pound;2,500 a year. The match proved childless and unhappy,
and it was only owing to Burnet's persuasions that she did not separate
from her husband in 1682. She died at Adderbury, 29 October, 1685,
and was buried at Winchendon on 10 November following. Anne
Wharton's <i>Elegy on the Death of the Earl of Rochester</i>, which may be
found in <i>Examen Miscellaneum</i> (1702), drew a poem from Waller in
which he says that she</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Shews that still in her he lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her Wit is graceful, great, and good,<br /></span>

<p>The earl's mother was aunt to Mrs. Wharton's father, Sir Henry Lee.
Rochester died 26 July, 1680. On p. 242 of <i>The Temple of Death</i>,
a miscellany (1695), may be read Mrs. Wharton's 'To Mrs. A. Behn,
on what she Writ of the Earl of Rochester'. Various other of her
poems have appeared in similar collections.</p>

name given to a Restoration revival of Randolph's beautiful and truly
poetic <i>Amyntas or The Impossible Dowry</i>. The title of the editio princeps
runs thus: <i>Amyntas or The Impossible Dowry. A Pastoral Acted before

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<p>In the pastoral, Ceres, by an obscure oracle, has announced the
dowry to be given to Urania, the daughter of her priest. Amyntas,
conceiving it impossible to bestow this required dowry, has lost his wits.
The wavering nymph is Laurinda. Eventually the divine riddle is
happily solved.</p>

<p>There is no record of the revival for which Mrs. Behn wrote
these two songs, but the play was undoubtedly put on at the Duke's
house. It was probably acted in 1682-3, when a large number of the
older plays were staged, especially such as gave scope for scenic effects
and the introduction of musical interludes. In the spring of 1703,
<i>Amyntas</i>, reduced to three acts as <i>The Fickle Shepherdess</i>, was produced
at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Mrs. Bracegirdle acted Amyntas, and Mrs.
Barry, Clorinda (Laurinda).</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_178">178</a> <i>The Disappointment</i>. This poem, which was extremely popular, was
sent by Mrs. Behn to John Hoyle, her friend, with a letter in which
she anxiously urges him to give the lie to various scandals of a grave
nature that were current concerning his private life. The letter and
the poem are both to be found in the various editions of <i>Familiar
Letters of Love, Gallantry, &amp;c.</i> This poem was also printed in <i>Poems on
Several Occasions by the Rt. Hon. the Earl of R&mdash;&mdash; Antwerpen.</i> [London.]
1680(?) And in <i>Poems on Several Occasion by the R. H. the E. of R.</i>
London. (1712). Under the title <i>The Insensible</i> it is to be found in the
following editions of Rochester, 1718; 1731; 1739 (in which year
there were two several and slightly divergent editions); 1752; 1800 (?);
and in a selected reprint <i>circa</i> 1884. In these editions which contain
<i>The Insensible</i>, <i>The Disappointment</i> is the title given to a different poem
seemingly based on Ovid, <i>Amorum</i>, iii, vii. The whole subject has
frequently been treated by poets and amorists of all time. Also cf.
<i>supra</i> note on a <i>Juniper-Tree</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. G. Thorn Drury has drawn my attention to the fact that
the original of Mrs. Behn's <i>The Disappointment</i>, entitled <i>Sur une
Impuissance</i> is to be found in <i>Recueil de Diverses Poesies Choisies Non
encore Imprim&eacute;es</i>. A Amsterdam, 1661. A full translation of the French
verses (Mrs. Behn's is only of part), appears in <i>Wit and Drollery</i> (1682),

this charming song to music, was born about 1656. He came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
England <i>circa</i> 1680, and soon found patrons, the chief of whom was
the Duchess de Mazarin, who, with the help of St. Evremond, continually
gave exquisite but elaborate concerts at Paradise Row, Chelsea.
In a little drawing-room scena Paisible is actually mentioned by name.
He is said to have won great favour owing to his easy manners and
fluent wit. 4 December, 1686, he procured a licence for his marriage
with one Mary Davis. About 1691 he began to supply overtures and
musical interludes for the theatres, and from 1703 to 1714 he set the
tunes to Isaac's dances performed at court on birthdays and other gala
occasions. He lived in the parish of S. Martin's-in-the-Fields, and died
August, 1721. Much of his work has been published and some yet
remain in MS. His are the overture and interludes to Southerne's
<i>Oroonoko</i>.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_189">189</a> <i>Set by Captain Pack</i>. Captain Pack was an exceedingly popular and
prolific musician of the day. The British Museum possesses four songs
of his in one volume (MS.). Some of his compositions may be found
in Playford's <i>Choice Ayres</i> (1675); in <i>The Theatre of Music</i> (1685-7); in
<i>The Banquet</i> (1688). Amongst other pieces he composed incidental
music for D'Urfey's <i>Don Quixote, I</i> and <i>II</i> (1694), both the first two
parts of which play were received with great applause.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_191">191</a> <i>Set by Mr. Farmer</i>. Thomas Farmer, Mus. Bac., was originally one of
the Waits of London. He graduated at Cambridge in 1684. He composed
much instrumental music for the theatre, and contributed some songs
to the second edition of Playford's <i>Choice Ayres</i> (1675), to <i>The Theatre
of Music</i> (1685-7), and to D'Urfey's <i>Third Collection of Songs</i> (1685).
His is the music to Lee's drama <i>The Princess of Cleve</i> (1682), and
various other compositions, including <i>A Consort of Musick</i> (1686), of
which work a second part followed a year or two after, bear his name.
As Purcell composed an elegy, the words by Nahum Tate, for his
funeral, Farmer must have died before 1695.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_204">204</a> <i>To the Honourable Edward Howard</i>. <i>The Six Days Adventure; or,
The New Utopia</i> was produced at the Duke's Theatre in 1671, and
printed quarto the same year. Although the best of Edward Howard's
comedies it was received with scant favour, and the author vindicates
himself, pretty sharply rebuking both actors and audience, in a long
preface.</p>

<p>Sir Grave Solymour, about to enter the bed of the chaste Celinda,
finds himself in the embraces of a black-a-moor, whilst his friends rush
in and jeer the precise old knight, whose 'night-hag' eventually proves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
to be Celinda's sooty page. The 'braver <i>Heroins</i>' of Howard, Serina,
Crispina, Eugenia, Petilla, wish to assume and usurp all the privileges
of the bolder sex. The scene lies in Utopia. Peacock, created by the
low comedian Angel, is a silly fribbling fop.</p>

<p>When the play was printed commendatory verses were prefixed
by Ravenscroft and Mrs. Behn, both of whom adopted Pindarics; by
J. T.; and by Sam Clyat.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Behn's <i>Miscellany</i> of 1685 is included '<i>A Pindaric by the
Honourable</i> Edward Howard <i>to Mrs.</i> B. <i>Occasioned by a Copy she made
on his Play, called the New</i> Eutopia'. The piece is fluent and not
ungraceful, concluding with a pretty compliment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Behn's Pindarick is reprinted in the <i>Muses Mercury</i>, October,
1707, with this note: 'The following Paper of Verses was written by
Mrs. <i>Behn</i>, to a Poet, who being damn'd, declar'd he wou'd write no
more: However out of Affection to his Brother Poets, he left Rules
for them to write; which she seems to judge kinder of than they
deserve; since both the Rules and the Critick are already entirely
forgot. The Reader will perceive that Mrs. <i>Behn</i> had no Notion of a
Pindarick Poem, any farther than it consisted of irregular Numbers,
and sav'd the Writer the Trouble of even Measure; which indeed is
all our common Pindarick Poets know of the Matter.'</p>

<p><i>Shee who late made the Amazons so Great</i> refers to Howard's tragicomedy,
<i>The Women's Conquest</i> (4to 1671), the scene of which lies in
Scythia, where we meet with several pseudo-classical Amazons.</p>

assemblies. An Italian and then an English song&mdash;('which won't

sung.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_210">210</a> <i>Song</i>. This song, with six additional verses (certainly not the work
of Mrs. Behn), is found in a broadside, which version is given in
Vol. IV. of the <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i> (pp. 656-9), issued by the Ballad
Society. In a similar way the song 'Ah Jenny gen your Eyes do kill',
sung in the <i>City Heiress</i> (<i>vide</i> Vol. II, p. 253), was in another broadside
amplified to no less than eighty lines, and dubbed 'The Loves of
Jockey and Jenny'. Ebsworth in his note on this song (<i>Roxburghe
Ballads</i>, VI, pp. 176-80) refers to Mrs. Behn and says: 'it is less
her handiwork than that of her friend Tom D'Urfey, who considered
himself <i>facile princeps</i> in the writing of Anglo-Scotch ditties'. Similar
treatment was accorded the 'Song made by a Gentlemen' in <i>Sir Patient
Fancy</i>, iii, i (Vol. IV, p. 44). For the ballad writer's additions to this
<i>vide</i> <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i>, VI (46-9). It is noticeable that these four
stanzas ('Young Jemmy was a Lad') under the title <i>Jemmey</i> appear
in <i>Female Poems on Several Occasions</i>. 'Written by Ephelia. The
Second Edition, with large Additions' (1682). They are not in the
first edition (1679) of these Poems. Jemmy is, of course, Monmouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>

of importance in Scotland, for which country he was in 1684 appointed
Secretary of State. Converted to Catholicism, with his brother (Lady
Anne Gordon, their mother, had been a staunch Catholic), the two are
said practically to have ruled Scotland for three years' space. A firm
follower of James II, he accompanied him to exile and supported all
his measures. During this period he was busy with many intrigues,
and was attainted in 1695. He died at Paris after a long illness in the

to have been on terms of intimacy with the great Purcell as well as
with Mrs. Behn. Dr. Kenrick is stated 'to have taken his degrees both

was the eldest son of Sir Francis Fane, K.B., F.R.S., of Fulbeck,
Lincolnshire, and Aston, Yorkshire. He was created a K.B. at the
coronation of Charles II. During the latter part of his life he retired to
his country estate at Henbury, Glos., where he died. His will is dated
14 November, 1689, and was proved 15 September, 1691. He is the
author of a comedy, a masque, and a tragedy. <i>Love in the Dark; or
The Man of Business</i> (4to, 1675), was produced at the Theatre Royal
with Lacy, Jo Haines, Mohun, Kynaston and Mrs. Boutel in the
cast. The scene is laid at Venice in Carnival time, and Intrigo, a good
character, was not forgotten by Mrs. Centlivre when she composed <i>The
Busy Body</i>. The Masque was written at Rochester's request for
his alteration of <i>Valentinian</i>. It may be found in Tate's <i>Poems by
Several Hands</i> (8vo, 1685). <i>The Sacrifice</i> (4to, 1689), was never acted,
and would hardly have succeeded on the stage. The scene lies in 'a
Revolted Fort in China'. It concludes with numerous deaths including
that of Tamerlane the Great. <i>Irene</i> is his daughter belov'd by <i>Axalla</i>
'General to Tamerlane'. <i>Despina</i> is the wife of the Emperor Bajazet.
<i>Ragalzan</i> is pithily designated a Villain, and he well merits the description.
There is a copy of prefatory verses 'To The Author' by

without merit, but yet do not occupy a noteworthy rank in our
theatrical library.</p>

March, 1707, with the following note: 'If it were proper to make
publick what we have learnt of the Story of the Author of the following
Verses, 'twould be an unquestionable Proof of their being <i>genuine</i>. For
they are all Writ with her own Hand in a Person's Book who was very
much her Friend; and from thence are now transcrib'd for the <i>Mercury</i>.
There are Fifteen or Sixteen Copies of Verse more, which will in due
time be printed in this Collection. There's no Man who knows any
thing of Mrs. <i>Behn's</i> way of Writing, but will presently see, that this Poem
was written by her Self; and the rest are of the same Character.' The
<i>Muses Mercury</i>, as a fact, gave eleven other poems beside the present
verses. Eight of these had already been printed: <i>On the first discovery of
falseness in Amintas</i> (p. 361) appears March, 1707, as <i>The Disoblig'd Love</i>.
<i>To Amintas</i> (p. 360) appears April, 1707, as <i>To Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;le, being belov'd
by both Sexes. Upon reading the Lives of the Romans</i>. <i>The Dream</i> (p. 183)
appears May, 1707, as <i>Cupid in Chains</i>. <i>Of The Return</i> (p. 173) the
first two stanzas appear August, 1707, as 'To J. Hoyle, Esq.' <i>Song</i>
(<i>When Jemmy first</i>) (p. 165) appears September, 1707, as <i>On Capt. &mdash;&mdash;
going to the War in Flanders</i>. <i>To the Honourable Edward Howard</i> (p. 204)
appears October, 1707, as <i>To the Author of a new Eutopia, A
Pindarick</i>. <i>The Willing Mistriss</i> (p. 163) appears December, 1707, as
<i>A Song for J. H.</i> <i>Mr. E. B. and Mrs. F. M.</i> (p. 159) appears January,
1708, as <i>The Loves of Mirtillo and Phillis</i>. From their notice and the
reprinting of so many pieces it would seem that the editors of the <i>Muses
Mercury</i> were not very well acquainted with Mrs. Behn's published Poems.</p>

are other variants. It will be remembered that in <i>The Rover, II</i>, v, 1
(Vol. I, p. 195), Willmore jestingly sings the fifth verse to La Nuche.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_368">368</a> <i>On the Death of the late Earl of Rochester.</i> John Wilmot, second Earl
of Rochester, libertine, poet, wit, died from a complication of ailments
due to his profligacies on 26 July, 1680, at the High Lodge, Woodstock
Park, whither he had journeyed in the preceding April. During the
last three months of his life he shewed signs of a sincere penitence.
He was much comforted by the ministrations of his chaplain, Robert
Parsons, and on 25 June he wrote to Gilbert Burnet to come and
receive his death-bed repentance. Burnet arrived 20 July, and stayed
four days, spending the time in consolatory exhortations and prayer.
Parsons' funeral sermon giving an account of Rochester's death and
penitence is well known, but Burnet's book, <i>Some Passages of the Life
and Death of John, Earl of Rochester</i> (1680, 8vo), has been even more
constantly re-issued. The Earl was buried in the north aisle of Spelsbury
church, Oxfordshire, but without any inscription or monument to
mark the grave.</p>

<p>Palsgrave, <i>Lesclarcissement de la Langue Fran&ccedil;oyse</i>, has: 'Cypres for a
woman's necke&mdash;<i>crespe</i>'; and Cotgrave, <i>Fr. Dict.</i>, 'Crespe: m. Cipres;
also Cobweb Lawne'. The etymology of the word has given rise to
much discussion. Skinner, <i>Etymol. Angl.</i>, regards it as a corruption of
the French <i>crepes</i>, but suggests that it may be derived from the island
of Cyprus where it was first manufactured. This is almost certainly
the case, cf. arras; cashmere; dimity; dornick; muslin, and many
more. Wheatley in his notes on <i>Every Man in His Humour</i> suggests
that Cyprus is derived from 'the plant <i>Cyperus textilis</i>, which is still used
for the making of ropes and matting.' One of the English names of
this plant was 'cypress'. Gerarde in his <i>Herbal</i> (1597) says: 'Cyperus
longus is called ... in English, Cypresse and Galingale.' Mr. Wheatley's
suggestion is ingenious but impossible. There is, moreover, ample
evidence in favour of the derivation from the isle Cyprus.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_379">379</a> <i>On the Author of that Excellent Book.</i> <i>The Way to Health, Long Life
and Happiness</i> was published (4to, 1682), as <i>Health's Grand Preservative;
or, the Women's Best Doctor</i> ... shewing the Ill-Consequences of
drinking Distilled Spirits and smoking Tobacco ... with a Rational
Discourse on the excellency of Herbs (2nd edition, 1691, 8vo, under
the first-named title; 3rd edition 1697). It is the work of Thomas
Tryon (1634-1703), 'Pythagorean', mystic, economist. This remarkable
man, of whom a full account may be found in the <i>Dic. Nat. Biog.</i>,
was long a fervent follower of Jacob Behmen, and forms an interesting
link between this enthusiast and the early quakers. In <i>The Way to
Health</i> he advocates a vegetable diet, complete abstinence from alcohol,
tobacco, and indeed all luxuries. This, however, is done without
fanaticism, and he has many pages of sound common sense. The
manual is in the highest degree interesting, and in spite of much quaint
detail his hygiene was excellent. Tryon died at Hackney, 21 August,
1703. This same poem appears prefixed to <i>The Way to make All People
Rich: or Wisdom's Call to Temperance and Frugality</i>, by Philotheos
Physiologus. [T. Tryon]. 12mo, 1685.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_382">382</a> <i>Epilogue to the Jealous Lovers</i>. <i>The Jealous Lovers</i>, which is by many
considered Randolph's best play, was originally acted before the King
and Queen at Cambridge by the students of Trinity. It was printed
quarto, 1632, with nine copies of English, and seven of Latin, verses.
The revival of this comedy at the Duke's house in 1682 met with
extraordinary success, and is mentioned by Langbaine. Nokes, who
spoke this epilogue, acted Asotus the prodigal, and <i>Leigh</i>, Ballio the
pimp. <i>Jo</i> and <i>Jack</i> are Joseph Williams and John Bowman who
sustained Tyndarus and Pamphilus.</p>

<p><i>Rebell Ward</i> is a sharp hit at Sir Patience Ward (1629-1696), the
ultra-protestant lord mayor of London, to which office he was elected
on Michaelmas day, 1680, entering on to his duties 29 October following.
He was a violent upholder of the city against the court, and in
1683 was tried for perjury in connection with the action brought by
the Duke of York against Sir Thomas Pilkington for <i>scandalum magnatum</i>.
On being found guilty he escaped to Holland but returned at the
Revolution. He died 10 July, 1696, and is buried in the chancel of
St. Mary Abchurch. This fanatic incurred much odium early in his
Mayoralty by having an additional inscription engraved on the Monument
to the effect that the Great Fire had been caused by the Catholics.
A similar inscription was placed on the house in Pudding Lane where
the fire began. Tom Ward (1652-1791), in his <i>England's Reformation</i>
(1710, canto iv, p. 100), jeering at Titus Oates and his fictions has the
following lines:&mdash;</p>

Camilla episode (Dryden's <i>Sylvae: or, the Second Part of Poetical Miscellanies</i>,
1685, p. 481), is the same person who translated other parts
of Virgil and Horace in the same Miscellany, Vols. I and II. In the
3rd edition of Vol. II he is called 'the Honourable Mr. John Stafford.'
Stafford is also the author of the Epilogue (sometimes erroneously
printed as Dryden's) to Southerne's <i>The Disappointment; or, The Mother
in Fashion</i> (1684, and 4to, 1684).</p>

Symonds in <i>The Greek Poets</i> 'was beyond the power of even Catullus:
that love-ode, which Longinus called "not one passion, but a congress
of passions," and which a Greek physician copied into his book of
diagnoses as a compendium of all the symptoms of corroding emotion,
appears but languid in its Latin dress of "Ille mi par." Far less has
any modern poet succeeded in the task: Rossetti, who deals so skilfully
with Dante and Villon, is comparatively tame when he approaches
Sappho.' This rendering of <i>The Ode to Anactoria</i> (as tradition names it)

Behn's name in Gildon's <i>Chorus Poetarum</i>, 1694. In <i>State Poems</i>, Vol. II
(1703), it is printed with the title <i>On Madam</i> Behn, a very different
matter. If the lines are Mrs. Behn's she must have versified them from
a translation given her by Hoyle or some other friend. In any case they
are graceful and far better than the versions of Ambrose Philips (1711),
or Smollett (1748). But, indeed, it is impossible to translate these lines
which are so truly 'mixed with fire' as Plutarch has it. For various
attempts and a literal prose version see Wharton's <i>Sappho</i>.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_391">391</a> <i>Complaint of the poor Cavaliers.</i> The <i>Muses Mercury</i>, June 1707,

Side: And tho her Manners was no Honour to any, yet her Wit made

as a Poet: for we find in the short Account of her Life, printed with
those of other <i>Poets</i>, she was employ'd by <i>Charles II.</i> in the Discovery
of the Dutch Intrigues in the Dutch War; which she was the better

time in <i>Surinam</i>, a Colony where there were many Dutch Merchants;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
and not long after she left it 'twas surrendered to that Republic by King
<i>Charles</i>. 'Tis well known, that the Gentlemen she speaks of in the

She was extremely beautiful, and either she or one of her unmarried
sisters was a mistress of the King.</p>

<p>The Lady Mary Howard, sister to the Earl of Carlisle, died in the
last week of October, 1694. She was notorious for her intrigues, and

party, as a red ribbon was of the Tories. North (<i>Examen</i>) gives
the following account of the green ribbon fraternity: 'This was the
club originally called the King's Head Club. The gentlemen of that
worthy society held their evening sessions continually at the King's
Head Tavern, over against the Inner Temple Gate. But upon occasion
of the signal of a green ribbon agreed to be worn in their hats, in the
days of street-engagements, like the coats of arms of valiant knights of
old, whereby all the warriors of that society might be distinguished,
and not mistake friends for enemies; they were called also the Green
Ribbon Club. Their seat was in a sort of car-four at Chancery-lane-end;
a centre of business and company most proper for such anglers of
fools. The house was double balconied in the front, as may be yet
seen, for the clubsters to issue forth in <i>fresco</i>, with hats and no
perruques; pipes in their mouths, merry faces, and diluted throats, for
the vocal encouragement of the <i>canaglia</i> below, at bonfires, on usual
and unusual occasions.' The Green Ribbon is frequently alluded to.

<p>p. <a href="#Page_400">400</a> <i>Mrs. Behn's Satyr on Dryden.</i> This acrid attack upon the great
laureate is ungenerous to a degree, and Mrs. Behn's jibes are the
more surprising, inasmuch as she had always been Tory to the backbone
and a particular partisan of King James II. No doubt continued ill
health and a hard struggle are largely responsible for her bad temper.
There can be no question that Dryden's conversion was absolutely
conscientious, and his line of action at the Revolution amply proves
his sincerity. Few, if any, critics would to-day venture to echo
Macaulay's discredited pronouncements, doubly dangerous that they
are from the vigour and charm of their expression. Burnet's partisan
libels and denunciation of Dryden can be dismissed as impertinent and
groundless. It is not to be supposed that on such an occasion the
whole horde of waspish Lilliputians, who hated the genius of glorious
John, would not pour forth a very torrent of venom and slime. Such
impotent pasquils as <i>The Renegado Poet</i>, and <i>To Mr.</i> Dryden <i>upon his declaring
himself a Roman Catholic</i> abound. Dryden, so far as we know, had
always shown himself kindly to Mrs. Behn. He included her paraphrase
of Ovid's <i>[OE]none to Paris</i> in the translation of Ovid's Epistles 'by
several Hands' (1680), and took care to pay her a graceful compliment
in the preface. Further, he allowed a prologue of his own to be used at
the production of her posthumous play, <i>The Widow Ranter</i>, in 1690.
His letter of advice to Corinna (Mrs. Thomas), which, with an
acknowledgement of the freedom of some of his own scenes, bids her
refrain from following the carelessness of the illustrious Astrea, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
written with reference to the mitigated taste of the last years of the
seventeenth century when Collier had already penned his diatribe of
decorum, rather than as a rebuke of, or a reflection upon Mrs. Behn.</p>

<p>I owe the present copy of this satire, which has never before been
printed, to the kindness of G. Thorn Drury, Esq., K.C., who generously
transcribed the lines, thirty-one in number, from a MS. in his possession,
which he copied from Haslewood, who writes 'From an old MS.
in my Port Folio'.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> <i>The Historical MSS. Commission Third Report</i>

this opportunity of most heartily thanking for the trouble he was put
to in the matter, finds that this leaf was one of a number of MSS.
restored by Bishop Danell in October, 1875, to the two sources
whence they had been borrowed by the Rev. Mark Tierney. These
were the Archivium of the late Cardinal Manning, and the Stonyhurst
collection. Fr. Cyril Martindale, S.J., informs me that the poem is
not to be found at Stonyhurst College. Nor can it be traced at Westminster.
The unfortunate conclusion is that it has been irretrievably
lost. A couplet would appear to have dropped out in the present copy.</p>

Rochester, 'a Preface concerning the Author and his Writings. <i>By one

It is curious to note that two publishers divided the risk of publication,
and on the title pages of different 4tos we have different names.
Mrs. Sarah Cook, who spoke this Prologue the first day, was an
actress of no little eminence and beauty. Her origin was humble (her
mother is said to have kept a tiny shop), and she early joined the
Nursery. In 1677 we find her cast for Gillian, when Leanard's wholesale
plagiarism of Brewer's <i>Country Girl</i> entitled <i>Country Innocence; or,
The Chambermaid turn'd Quaker</i>, was produced during Lent by the
younger part of the Theatre Royal Company, with help from such
experienced performers as Haynes, Lydal, Goodman, Mrs. Marshall
and Mrs. Knipp. The following year Mrs. Cook acted Flora in <i>The
Rambling Justice</i>, another Nursery play, also put on in Lent. Langbaine
ascribes this comedy to Leanard, and much of it is stolen in his style.
Amongst Mrs. Cook's many r&ocirc;les after she had joined the King's Company
as a regular actress were:&mdash;1681, Livia, in D'Urfey's <i>Sir Barnaby
Whig</i>; 1682, Semanthe, in Southerne's <i>The Loyal Brother</i>; The
Countess of Rutland in Banks' <i>The Unhappy Favourite</i>. After the
Union of the Companies (first performance 16 November, 1682),
Mrs. Cook, who had already taken a high place, acted parts of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>importance. We find that she spoke the Epilogue to Dryden and Lee's
<i>The Duke of Guise</i> (December, 1682), and in 1683 she appears as
Spaconia in a notable revival of <i>A King and No King</i>. The same
year she possibly acted the Countess in Ravenscroft's <i>Dame Dobson</i>. In
1684 she played Serena in Lee's <i>Constantine the Great</i>; Erminia in
Southerne's <i>The Disappointment</i>; Portia, in a revival of <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>;
1685, Aminta in D'Urfey's <i>The Commonwealth of Women</i>; Edith, in a
revival of <i>Rollo, Duke of Normandy</i>; 1686, Lady Lovemore in Jevon's
farce, <i>A Devil of A Wife</i>; Donna Elvira in D'Urfey's <i>The Banditti</i>;
1687, Letitia in Mrs. Behn's <i>The Lucky Chance</i>; Quisara in Tate's
poor alteration of <i>The Island Princess</i>; Elaria, in Mrs. Behn's farcical
<i>The Emperor of the Moon</i>. Genest who records this as her last r&ocirc;le says
that she quitted the stage at this time. It has been stated that she died
in the winter of 1687. At any rate her name no longer appears, and
her place was amply filled by the advent of Mrs. Bracegirdle. Mrs.
Cook was celebrated for speaking saucy and political epilogues, e.g.
that to <i>The Duke of Guise</i>, and, again, Dryden's brilliant epilogue to
<i>Constantine the Great</i>. A MS. (Harleian) <i>Satire on the Players</i> (c. 1682-3)
coarsely vilipends her thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Impudent <i>Sarah</i> thinks she's praised by all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mistaken Drab, back to thy Mother's stall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let true Savin whom thou hast proved so well;</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis a rare thing that belly will not swell,</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though swived and swived and as debauched as hell.</span>
  <span class="rightalign">}<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the Second Day of <i>Valentinian</i> a second prologue was spoken by
Mrs. Cook. They are clever verses, and with regard to the critics who
gird at Rochester, some 'for his want of Wit', and others because 'he
too obscenely writ', it is said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like <i>Falstaffe</i> let 'em conquer Heroes dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And praise <i>Greek</i> Poets they cou'd never read.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The third 'Prologue intended for <i>Valentinian</i>, to be spoken by <i>Mrs.
Barrey</i>' contains the famous lines with reference to the dead author:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some Beauties here I see&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though now demure, have felt his pow'rful Charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And languish'd in the circle of his Arms.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_402">402</a> <i>Jenny.</i> A well-known orange wench to whom there are allusions in the
satires of the day. 'Jenny' is sometimes also a generic name for a mask.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_402">402</a> <i>Blanket Fair.</i> Evelyn, 6 January, 1684, notes 'the river quite
frozen', and on the 9th writes: 'I went across the Thames on the ice,
now become so thick as to bear not only streets of booths, in which they
roasted meat, and had divers shops of wares, quite across as in a town,
but coaches, carts and horses passed over.' On subsequent days he notes
the continuance of this frost, and on 24 January has a famous description
of the Thames fair with its 'sleds, sliding with skates, a bull-baiting,
horse and coach-races, puppet-plays and interludes, cooks,
tippling, and other lewd places, so that it seemed to be a bacchanalian
triumph, or carnival on the water'. A printing press was even set up
and cards printed, one of which is given, dated 5 February, in a note
by Bray, <i>Evelyn's Diary</i>, II (p. 192) (1850).</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_403">403</a> <i>To Henry Higden.</i> Henry Higden, to whose translation of Juvenal's
tenth satire Mrs. Behn prefixed these complimentary verses, was a well-known
wit of the day. A Yorkshireman, a member of the Middle
Temple, he moved in the best and gayest society. In 1686 he published
<i>A Modern Essay on the Thirteenth Satyr of Juvenal</i> (Licensed 11 November,
1685), and in 1687 followed this up by <i>A Modern Essay on the Tenth
Satyr of Juvenal</i>. With Mrs. Behn's Poem are also printed verses by Dryden
and Settle. Higden is the author of a good comedy, <i>The Wary Widdow:
or, Sir Noisy Parrat</i> (4to, 1693). Sir Charles Sedley wrote the prologue,
there are six copies (one by Tom Brown in Latin), of complimentary
verses, and the play is dedicated to the Earl of Dorset and Middlesex.
A legend exists that the author 'had introduced so much punch-drinking
into it that the actors got intoxicated before the end of the third act, and
the house separated in confusion'. This seems to me dubious at the least,
and if true the actors must have begun in a singularly mellow condition.
Sir Noisy, indeed (Act i), declares 'we must banish <i>Venus</i> out of our
Calender, Jolly <i>Bacchus</i> shall rejoyce our hearts, and be our Dominical
Letter,' yet in Act ii, sc. iii, he toasts Clarinda's health but once and
that in 'Wine and Colour'd water'; whilst Act iii, sc. vi, '<i>the</i> Rose
Tavern' where Sir Noisy gets drunk with Scaredevil and Fulham is somewhat
quiet for a toping of the period. In Act iv Nantz is quaffed on shipboard,
but all the rest of the play is temperate enough, and the tradition
(repeated ad nauseam), must indubitably be dismissed as pure fiction.
Higden in his Preface ascribes the doom of <i>The Wary Widdow</i> to those
'Sons of <i>Zeruiah</i>', the 'murmuring <i>Israelites</i>' and 'Pagans of the Pits'
who 'hissing, mimicking, ridiculing, and Cat-calling' utterly 'vanquished
the stage', and dumbfounded the unfortunate performers. No doubt
a braying clique damned the piece. It may be noted that in his Preface
Higden takes occasion to gird at the recent success of Congreve's <i>The
Old Bachelor</i>.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_405">405</a> <i>On the Death of E. Waller, Esq.</i> Edmund Waller died at Hall Barn,
21 October, 1687, and on 26 October was buried in Beaconsfield churchyard.
This elegy of Mrs. Behn's was first printed in a collection entitled
<i>Poems to Memory of that Incomparable Poet Edmund Waller, Esquire</i>.
'By Several Hands.' 1688. The volume (27 pages), contains poems by
Sir John Cotton, Bart.; Sir Tho. Higgons; T. Rymer; Monsieur St.
Evremon (six lines in French, with an English translation by T. R.);
George Granville; Bevill Higgons; A. Behn; an Anonymous Poem;
and 'To Mr. Riley, Drawing Mr. Waller's Picture', signed T. R. The
letter accompanying these lines sent by Mrs. Behn to Waller's daughter-in-law,
will be found in the Memoir (Vol. I, pp. l-li).</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_407">407</a> <i>A Pindaric Poem.</i> For the occasion of this Poem <i>vide</i> Vol. I, p. liii.
From stanza 4 it would appear that Dr. Burnet had suggested to Mrs.
Behn that she should write a Pindaric or some similar poem on William
of Orange and his consort. To her credit she refused. The verses <i>To
Her Sacred Majesty Queen Mary</i> are more than ample on such themes.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
